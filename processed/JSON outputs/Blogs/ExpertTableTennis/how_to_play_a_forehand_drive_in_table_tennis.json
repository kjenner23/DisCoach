"terme": "Forehand drive",
"definition": "One of the four basic table tennis strokes; an attacking stroke played with a small amount of topspin (a drive shot, not a topspin loop).",
"contexte": "Played against long or medium-length topspin or float balls; not off short balls (that would be a flick) and not off backspin; usually from the forehand side, often from the middle, and sometimes from the backhand side by advanced players.",

"debutant": [
"Adopt the stance: feet slightly wider than shoulder width; right foot slightly back (right-hander); knees slightly bent; lean the body forward; both arms out in front; elbow bent roughly 90–110°; stand about an arm’s length from the table; weight on the balls/toes.",
"Backswing: rotate the body to the right from the hips; elbow and bat rotate back with the body; slightly close the bat angle; shift weight onto the back (right) foot.",
"Strike: rotate hips and shoulders forward to meet the ball; arm moves forward with the body; slightly accelerate the forearm at contact (like a military salute); transfer weight to the front (left) foot; keep the bat angle closed; contact the ball at peak bounce and in front of the body; maintain a small gap between elbow and body.",
"Finish: follow through forward and upward; bat should finish roughly pointing where you hit the ball; return to the ready position."
],
"intermediaire": [
"Emphasize hip-driven rotation (the body moves the arm).",
"Maintain a consistently closed bat angle throughout the stroke.",
"Contact timing: take the ball at the peak of the bounce and out in front.",
"Weight transfer sequence: back foot in backswing → front foot at contact.",
"Keep a small elbow–body gap to allow rotation and control."
],
"avance": [
"Direction control: finish with the bat pointing where the ball was placed.",
"Recovery efficiency: complete the finish and immediately return to ready position.",
"Forearm acceleration cue: add a brief acceleration at contact for a crisper strike while keeping the wrist relatively straight."

"Upper body moving forward while lower body moves backward (poor weight transfer).",
"Rotating from the shoulders instead of the hips.",
"Tucking the elbows into the body, limiting rotation and power.",
"Swinging only the arm without moving the body (power should come from body rotation and weight transfer; arm for control).",
"Dropping the wrist so the racket faces downwards (reduced control and softer shot).",
"Over-rotating so the bat finishes across the body or over the neck (bat should finish pointing where you hit the ball).",
"Contacting below peak bounce on a drive.",
"Changing bat angle during the stroke instead of keeping it closed throughout."
