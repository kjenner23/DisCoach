    "text": "Start Here\nWelcome to Expert Table Tennis! If you want to get better at table tennis – but you’re not really sure how – this is the site for you.\nAbout Me\nHi, I’m\nBen Larcombe\n. I’m 30 years old, I live in Tunbridge Wells (England), and I’m a professional table tennis coach.\nI started\nExpert Table Tennis\nback in 2012 with the belief that everyone has the potential to become an expert at table tennis. The site has evolved and grown a lot and now includes regular\nblog posts\n, a monthly\npodcast\n, a selection of coaching videos, a\nbook\n, and\na thriving online community\n.\nSpend just a few minutes reading or listening to any of my work and you’ll realize that I’m super passionate about table tennis! I particularly enjoy teaching the fundamentals to new players and helping them to find the most direct path to ping pong prowess.\nIn 2015, my\ntable tennis coaching\nhit the headlines after my YouTube video ‘Guy Plays Table Tennis Every Day for a Year’ went viral. It’s since received over 12 million views and has been featured on\nBBC News\n,\nThe Huffington Post\n, and\nThe Telegraph\n.\nI now coach at\nSt John’s Table Tennis Club\nin Tunbridge Wells. It’s a small club, aimed at beginners and improvers, that meets on Tuesday evenings in the basement of St John’s Church.\nOther than that, I’m a Bible-believing Christian and I have a wide variety of other interests including; sports science, online business, economics, and running (to name just a few). I’m also the co-founder of\nPipehouse Gin\n!\nIf you’d like to find out more about me then why not follow me on social media? You can find me on\nFacebook\n,\nTwitter\n,\nInstagram\n, and\nYouTube\n.\nMy Table Tennis Story (so far)\nI’ve been involved in table tennis for over 20 years! Here’s a brief summary…\n1989\n– Born in South London\n1999\n– Started playing table tennis at a local leisure centre\n2001\n– Moved to Crusaders TTC (Head Coach: Mike Pantin)\n2004\n– First represented Surrey and finished the U15s ranked #107\n2007\n– Finished the U18s #76 and joined Grantham Academy\n2009\n– Studied Coaching and Sport Science at Nottingham Trent\n2011\n– Graduated and began coaching professionally in London\n2012\n– Started ExpertTableTennis.com\n2013\n– Reached a peak ranking of #123 in England (then got married)\n2014\n– Completed The Expert in a Year Challenge – with Sam Priestley\n2016\n– Started St John’s TTC in Tunbridge Wells\n2017 –\nBegan working one-to-one with Harrie Austin-Jones\nI don’t consider myself to be a table tennis expert – far from it! I’m just a coach that loves the game and loves to learn.\nExpert in a Decade?\nSo, in 2014 I did\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nwith Sam Priestley. The goal was to coach Sam into the top 250 table tennis players in England in just one year.\nTowards the end of the year, it became obvious that reaching that sort of level in one year (even with a massive amount of one-to-one coaching) just isn’t possible. I remember jokingly texting Sam… “\nExpert in a Decade?\n“\nWell, in April 2017 I was approached by a young (and naive) chap called\nHarrie Austin-Jones\n– who was 9 months into his own long-term table tennis challenge. Since then, I’ve been coaching him once a week and he’s been steadily improving.\n‘Expert in a Year’ sounds great. But ‘Expert in a Decade’ is probably more realistic. It reminds me of a quote by Bill Gates…\nMost people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.\nBill Gates\nHarrie has committed to table tennis for the foreseeable future. If you want to become a top player, that’s what it takes. You probably need to be training and competing 3-4 times a week, for 10 years, before you’ll get anywhere near “expert” status.\nA lot of the content you’ll find on Expert Table Tennis is now linked to Harrie’s progress. We record\na monthly podcast\ntogether chatting about all of his latest breakthroughs and struggles. I also write\na coaching blog post\neach month that is usually linked to something we’ve been working on in Harrie’s training.\nThe best way to follow Harrie’s “epic table tennis journey” is to subscribe to our\npodcast\nand follow us on Instagram…\n@epictabletennis\n@benlarcombe\nThe Best of Expert Table Tennis\nI’ve created a lot of content over the past eight years. Unfortunately, much of it is now lost “in the archives”. Here’s the best of it…\nBlog Posts\nIs It Possible to Master Table Tennis in 12 Months?\nAre You Too Old to Start Playing Table Tennis?\nHow to Return Spin Serves\nThe Four Basic Table Tennis Strokes\nHow to Play Aggressive Table Tennis at 50+ Like He ZhiWen\nWhy is China So Good at Table Tennis?\n1 Key Tip to Improve Your Serve\nCommon Table Tennis Injuries and How to Avoid Them\nHow to Play ‘Relaxed’ Table Tennis\n5 Tips to Improve Your Table Tennis Fitness\nPodcast Episodes\nETT 001 – Matt Hetherington: Consistency vs Power\nETT 003 – Alex Polyakov: Breaking 2000\nETT010 – Rory Scott: Expert in a Year Mark II\nETT 019 – Jesper Ratzer: 6x World Racketlon Champion\nETT 020 – Larry Hodges: Table Tennis Tactics for Thinkers\nETT 026 – Brett Clarke: How to Serve Like a Boss!\nETT 028 – Brian Pace: Shadow Training for Table Tennis\nETT 032 – William Henzell: Time to Retire\nETT 033 – Sean O’Neill: Top Tips for Intermediate Players\nETT 038 – Colin Wilson: How to Fulfil Your Potential\nYouTube Videos\nHow to Improve Your Shakehands Table Tennis Grip\nThe Power of Practice\nHow to Build Your Own Custom Table Tennis Bat\nMetronome Table Tennis Training\nExpert in a Year Q&A Session\nBig Projects, Guides, & Free Downloads\nAnd here’s some of my cornerstone content.

This makes the bat market a bit of a minefield for beginners. If you’d like to learn more about pre-made bats then I recommend reading my blog post,\nThe Best Table Tennis Bats for Beginners and Intermediate Players\n. Otherwise, here are my favourite bats/rackets/paddles.\nEastfield Allround\n:\nIf you’re new to the sport of table tennis this is the racket you should buy. It gives you the ability to create loads of spin without being too fast or difficult to control. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£49.95)\nor\nAmazon.com ($59.95)\n.\nEastfield Offensive\n:\nThis bat is aimed at intermediate and advanced-level table tennis players. It’s the bat I use myself! Great for giving you more power without losing control and feeling. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£99.95)\nor\nAmazon.com ($119.95)\n.\nPalio Expert 3.0\n:\nThe #1 best seller on Amazon.co.uk and the perfect bat for players learning the game and starting out. It’s an amazing bat and, in my opinion, is the best you can get for under £30. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£29.99)\nor\nAmazon.com ($39.99)\n.\nPalio Legend 3.0\n:\nThis is the most aggressive of the Palio bats. The Hadou rubbers are slightly harder and faster than the CJ8000 rubbers found on the Palio Expert 3.0. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£44.99)\nor\nAmazon.com ($64.99)\n.\nI’m always surprised by how many players spend a small fortune on their bat/racket just to chuck it in their bag. If you’re interested in protecting your expensive new table tennis bat, check out my popular article,\nThe Best Table Tennis Bat Cases\n. For now, here is my favourite bat case.\nEastfield Original\n:\nThis bat case takes inspiration from the current trend in iPad and laptop cases. It comes in three colours (black, grey or navy) and has a single or double bat version. I wonder how long it will be before the big table tennis brands start producing bat cases that look more like this and less awful! Buy via\nAmazon\nor\nMegaspin\n.\nTable Tennis Bat Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis racket reviews…\nButterfly 401\nDHS A3002\nDHS A4002\nDHS A5002\nDHS A6002\nEastfield Allround\nEastfield Offensive\nKillerspin JET200\nKillerspin JET600\nKillerspin JET800\nPalio Expert 2\nPalio Master 2\nPalio Legend 2\nStiga Apex\nStiga Titan\nStiga Supreme\nStiga Evolution\nStiga Pro Carbon\nFor more information, check out my popular blog post\nThe Best Table Tennis Rackets for Beginners and Intermediate Players\n.\nTable Tennis Rubbers\nIf you can’t find a ready-made table tennis bat you like, you can always buy two sheets of rubber and a blade separately and glue them together (I made a YouTube video showing how\nhere\n). But there are well over 1,000\nITTF approved table tennis rubbers\n. How do you pick which one is right for you? I’m here to help!\nButterfly Tenergy 05\n:\nThere are thousands of rubbers to choose from but (basically ever since they were released) Tenergy 05 has been the most popular. I used Tenergy for many years. Buy from\nMegaspin.net ($79.99)\nor\nBribar (£58.99)\n.\nTibhar Evolution MX-P\n:\nI was sent a couple of sheets of MX-P to test and review in 2015 and I loved them. I found Evolution MX-P to be very similar to Tenergy 05. Buy from\nTabletennis11.com (€46.90)\nor\nBribar (£44.99)\n.\nWhile boosting your table tennis rubbers is technically against\nITTF rules\n, it’s commonplace among elite players! If you’re interested in boosting your rubbers you should check out my articles,\nHow to Boost Your Table Tennis Rubber\nand\nThe Best Table Tennis Booster\n.\nFalco Tempo Long Booster\n:\nThis is undoubtedly the most popular booster currently available. The manufacturer claims the effects can last from 8-12 weeks, which is much longer than the typical 7-10 days of other products. Buy from\nTabletennis11.com (€27.00)\nor\nMegaspin.net ($29.99)\n.\nTable Tennis Rubber Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis rubber reviews…\nAdidas Tenzone Ultra\nEastfield A-Pro\nEastfield A-Soft\nStiga Airoc Astro\nTibhar Evolution MX-P\nTibhar Evolution EL-S\nTibhar Evolution FX-S\nVictas V > 15 Extra\nXiom Vega Japan\nFor a more detailed look at some of the best table tennis rubbers currently available check out my blog post,\nThe Best Table Tennis Rubbers\n.\nTable Tennis Blades\nChoosing the perfect blade can be even more confusing than selecting rubbers. Table tennis blades can be expensive, but they usually last for many years. Therefore, you want to make sure you get one you like. I would definitely recommend trying out other people’s blades and bat combinations before making a decision.\nEastfield Ashwood\n:\nI’ve been playing with the Eastfield Ashwood blade myself for the past 18 months – and I love it! It’s an allwood 7-ply offensive blade. Plenty of speed and loads of control/feeling. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£50)\nor\nAmazon.com ($60)\n.\nButterfly Timo Boll ALC\n:\nThis is the blade I was using before I switched to the Eastfield Ashwood. It’s a carbon blade that was designed for the European looping style of play, with a great balance of speed and control. Buy from\nMegaspin.net ($159.99)\n.\nTable Tennis Blade Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis blade reviews…\nEastfield Allwood\nEastfield Ashwood\nStiga Carbonado 245\nStiga Carbonado 290\nThere are, of course, thousands of other blades. For more information on selecting the right blade for you, check out my popular article,\nThe Best Table Tennis Blades\n.\nTable Tennis Balls\nTable tennis balls have changed! The old celluloid balls have been replaced by plastic balls, also known as poly balls. There are only five manufacturers of the new 40+ plastic table tennis balls; Minkow (Xushaofa), DHS, Double Fish, Nittaku, and Weener (Butterfly). Read my blog post,\nThe Best Table Tennis Balls\n, to find out more.\nXushaofa 3-Star\n:\nI recommend the Chinese-made Xushaofa seamless balls over all the other Chinese seamed alternatives. I believe these are generally better quality and much more durable. Buy from\nMegaspin.net (USA)\n,\nBribar (UK)\nor\nTabletennis11.com (Worldwide)\n.\nNittaku Premium 3-Star\n:\nThese seamed balls are made exclusively for Nittaku in their Japanese factory. The best quality 40+ 3-star balls on the market but more expensive than Xushaofa. Buy from\nAmazon (Worldwide)\nor\nMegaspin (USA)\n.\nTable Tennis Ball Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis ball reviews…\nButterfly G40+ 3-Star\nDHS 3-Star\nDouble Fish 3-Star\nNittaku Premium 3-Star\nXushaofa 3-Star\nFor more information on 40+ table tennis balls, check out my popular blog post\nThe Best Table Tennis Balls\n.\nTable Tennis Tables\nI’ve written a very comprehensive blog post on\nThe Best Table Tennis Tables\nwhich is recommended reading if you’re thinking of buying a table tennis table. I talk about all sorts of tables; indoor, outdoor, cheap, expensive, and also explain a little about the importance of table thickness and how to decide which table is best for you.\nJOOLA Tour 2500\n:\nThis is the best-value 25mm table tennis table available in the USA. The 2019 version has improved 4″ wheels and can be built in less than 20 minutes. Buy from\nMegaspin ($629)\n.\nTibhar SP Allstar\n:\nThis is the best value 25mm table tennis table available in the UK. It was created in a collaboration between Tibhar and San-Ei. Amazingly, it’s also ITTF approved tournament-ready! Buy from\nBribar (£599)\n.\nStiga Advantage\n/\nJOOLA Inside\n:\nThese two tables are virtually identical. I think they come from the same factory and they fight each other for the #1 best seller spot on Amazon.com! They have a 15mm surface and a solid frame. Basic but great value at under $400. Buy from Amazon.com –\nStiga Advantage\nor\nJOOLA Inside\n.\nDonnay Premium Indoor Outdoor\n:\nStrangely, it’s called “Indoor Outdoor” but this is an indoor table. Don’t keep this outside! However, this is the “premium” 15mm version and that makes it the cheapest 15mm table tennis table I can find in the UK. Buy from\nAmazon UK (£199)\n.\nKettler Outdoor 10\n/\nChamp 5.0\n:\nThese are two amazing outdoor table tennis tables. The best, in fact. I used to do all of my one-to-one coaching session on one of these and it plays exactly like an indoor table! Buy from\nAmazon UK (£699)\nor\nMegaspin ($1,049)\n.\nThere is nothing worse than a rubbish net that is always falling off or sagging in the middle. It will ruin your game and probably drive you insane in the process! I’ve written a blog post looking at\nThe Best Table Tennis Nets\nto help you choose a good one. Here are my favourites.\nTera Retractable\n:\nThese retractable nets (sometimes called “rollnets”) are brilliant for use on any kind of table. This one can extend to 2m in length and will clip onto any surface less than 5cm thick. It’s also very good value. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£10.99)\nor\nAmazon.com ($11.96)\n.\nButterfly Clip\n:\nClip nets are great if you want something a little more serious which is still super easy to put on and take off the table. The Butterfly Clip has been a favourite among schools and clubs for years and if very good value. Buy from\nAmazon.co.uk (£19.00)\nor\nAmazon.com ($36.66)\n.\nTable Tennis Table Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis table reviews…\nIndoor Tables\nButterfly Compact 19\nButterfly Europa\nHarvil Insider\nJoola Inside\nJOOLA Inside vs Stiga Advantage – The Best Table Under $400\nJoola Rally TL 300\nJoola Tour 2500\nKillerspin Revolution\nStiga Advantage\nStiga Legacy\nOutdoor Tables\nButterfly Compact Outdoor\nHarvil Outsider\nJoola Nova DX Outdoor\nKettler Classic Outdoor 10\nStiga XTR Outdoor\nFor more help selecting a table tennis table, check out my popular blog post\nThe Best Table Tennis Tables\n.\nTable Tennis Robots\nA table tennis robot can be a great training aid, especially in the early stages of your development or if you can’t find a suitable practice partner. For a more detailed overview of\nThe Best Table Tennis Robots\n, check out my blog post. Otherwise, here are three that I recommend.\nPower Pong 5000\n:\nIt’s identical to the Butterfly Amicus Prime (the best table tennis robot in the world) but $430 cheaper – if you buy direct and use my unique discount code…\nBL5000\n.\nPower Pong 2001\n:\nIf you can’t afford the Power Pong 5000, the 2001 model is a great mid-range option. It’s not quite as fancy but costs just $1,249 – if you buy direct and use my unique discount code…\nBL2001\n.\niPong Trainer Motion\n:\nThis is a basic table-top table tennis robot that replaces the popular iPong V300. It doesn’t really compare to a Power Pong robot but it’s much much cheaper. Buy from\nMegaspin ($199.95)\n.\nTable Tennis Robot Reviews\nHere are links to all of my table tennis robot reviews…\nButterfly Amicus Basic\nButterfly Amicus Advance\nButterfly Amicus Professional\niPong v300\nNewgy Robo-Pong 540\nNewgy Robo-Pong 1040\nNewgy Robo-Pong 1050\nNewgy Robo-Pong 2040\nNewgy Robo-Pong 2050\nPower Pong 2001\n(\nSave $50 with the code “BL2001”\n)\nPower Pong 3001\n(\nSave $100 with the code “BL3001”\n)\nPower Pong 5000\n(\nSave $100 with the code “BL5000”\n)\nPractice Partner 20\nFor more information, check out my popular blog post\nThe Best Table Tennis Robots\n.\nTable Tennis Shoes\nIf you’re playing competitive table tennis, your contact with the floor is very important. If you want to learn more, check out my blog post\nThe Best Table Tennis Shoes\n. Otherwise, here’s my favourite pair of table tennis shoes.\nMizuno Wave Drive\n:\nMizuno produces brilliant table tennis shoes that are very popular among players of all abilities. Sam bought a pair of Mizuno Wave Drive 6s at the beginning of\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\n. Buy from\nTabletennis11 (Worldwide)\nor\nBribar (UK)\n.\nOr if you’re after a cheap pair of table tennis shoes, I normally find mine in the bargain bin at a tournament!\nMy Favourite Table Tennis Retailers\nFor me, there are three stand-out specialist online table tennis retailers at the moment; Megaspin, Bribar and Tabletennis11.\nMegaspin\n:\nIf you’re in the USA, I recommend using\nMegaspin.net\n. They offer North America’s largest selection of table tennis equipment and have been going since 1996.\nBribar\n:\nIf you’re in the UK, I recommend using\nBribarTT.co.uk\n. They offer an amazing range of brands, great service, and now have both Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford on their books!\nTabletennis11\n:\nFor everywhere else, I like\nTabletennis11.com\nas they have really great prices and offer free worldwide shipping on orders over €70. You also get an extra 25% off if your order is over €250!\nAFFILIATE DISCLAIMER: Some of the links on this page are affiliate links (which means that if you go through my link and purchase an item I receive a small commission).

Ultimately, we failed.

In 2015, it received a much-needed update and professional redesign.\nThe Table Tennis Playbook is intended to be a comprehensive training manual for table tennis players of all abilities.

    "title": "How to Play Table Tennis (in 12 Simple Steps)",
    "text": "How to Play Table Tennis (in 12 Simple Steps)\nDo you want to learn how to play table tennis? You’ve come to the right place!\nHow to Play Table Tennis in 10 Days is an accelerated table tennis course that will systematically teach you the proper fundamentals of table tennis technique in ten simple steps. It’s the fastest way for beginners to learn how to play table tennis.\nI’ve coached thousands of beginners (literally)\nHello, my name is\nBen Larcombe\n. I’m a table tennis coach from London and I’ve spent the last five years teaching table tennis to beginners in schools, clubs, privately and (very publicly) in\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\n.\nOver those five years, I have been refining my coaching process and deconstructing the sport of table tennis into its most essential chunks.\nI’ve certainly made plenty of mistakes along the way but I’ve learnt from each and every one of them and now I’ve reached a point where I am happy with my coaching system and ready to share it with the world.\nTable tennis is a highly complex sport but at its simplest, it can be broken down into just a few key parts. Focus exclusively on these and you’ll be a proficient table tennis player in no time (10 days to be precise).\nThat isn’t to say you’ll be an ‘expert’ in 10 days (if there is one thing I learnt from\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nit’s that mastery takes time) but you should be at a level where you can easily beat your friends and family.\nThis is only the beginning. True mastery of the game of table tennis takes many years but you’ve got to start somewhere and I believe\nHow to Play Table Tennis in 10 Days\nis the best start you can have.\nContents\nIntroduction\nDay 1 – Grip\nDay 2 – Stance\nDay 3 – Footwork\nDay 4 – Forehand Drive\nDay 5 – Backhand Drive\nDay 6 – Backhand Push\nDay 7 – Forehand Push\nDay 8 – Serve\nDay 9 – Return of Serve\nDay 10 – Match Play\nWhat Next?\nIntroduction\nWhat are the fundamentals of table tennis?\nAnswering that question can be tricky, and I’m sure different coaches have different ideas on this, but I like to include the following (and ignore everything else, for now);\nGrip\nStance\nFootwork\nForehand Drive\nBackhand Drive\nBackhand Push\nForehand Push\nServe\nReturn of serve\nMatch Play\nThat’s ten skills you’ll need to master and I recommend you tackle them in that order.\nThe first three\n(grip, stance and footwork) are the foundations you need to lay at the beginning. Many players (and even coaches) skip over these and jump straight into hitting balls. Do so at your peril! Weak foundations can cause your whole game to fall down or prevent you from being able to continue building and improving later on. I like to think of this as the Mr Miyagi phase of learning.\nThe middle four\n(forehand drive, backhand drive, backhand push and forehand push) are\nthe four basic table tennis strokes\nand will make up the bulk of your game. Mastering the correct technique is really important here if you are to develop consistency and accuracy with your shots.\nThe final three\n(serve, return of serve and match play) are the finishing touches that will allow you to convert your newly learnt skills into points in a match. It is no good being excellent at rallying if your abilities don’t transition into a competitive situation.\nWhen I say 10 days… I mean 10 days!\nIf you think an hour-long practice is going to be enough to master each of these skills I’m afraid you’re mistaken. I am expecting you to require at least 5 hours per skill before you reach a good level of competency. That’s roughly 50 hours in total.\nYou could do 5 hours a day over two weeks (10 days). I believe that to be the ideal way to learn. A sort of ‘crash course’ in table tennis.\nAlternatively, if you don’t have two weeks free, you could break it down into smaller chunks:\nAn hour a day (5 hours a week) over 10 weeks.\nAn hour a week over a year.\nYou should come up with a realistic plan for your 50 hours of training NOW! Before you start. You will also need to find a partner, partners, or club to practice with.\nFinally, you need to buy a table tennis bat. It can be tricky choosing a bat and the big brands don’t help by sticking professional player’s faces on completely useless bats. To help you to understand what to look for in a good table tennis bat I have written the following article:\nThe Best Table Tennis Bat for Beginners\n.\nOnce you’ve got all of that sorted it’s time to begin the training…\nDay 1 – Grip\nThe first fundamental table tennis skill you need to learn is a correct grip. There are two main grips in table tennis; shakehands and penhold.\nThe penhold grip is a traditional Asian grip where the bat is held like a pen between the thumb and index finger. The penhold grip has some advantages (it allows for more wrist movement and therefore more spin) but it is also more difficult to learn. Penhold players either use one side of the bat for forehand and backhand or they have to master the tricky reverse penhold backhand stroke. There are still penhold players at the top of the world rankings (Xu Xin) but the style does seem to be decreasing in popularity, even in China.\nThe shakehands grip is the traditional European grip that is now being used increasingly by Asian players as well. I have used the shakehands grip since I started playing table tennis over 15 years ago and therefore I will be teaching this style of grip.\nThere are many minor variations within the shakehands grip and everybody holds the bat slightly differently. I made the following video after spending 10 weeks experimenting with my grip during the beginning of 2015.\nThat video has received a lot of positive feedback and it gives a much better explanation of my current thoughts on the grip than\nmy original blog post\n(which I wrote in 2013).\nI am thinking of calling this grip ‘the relaxed shakehands grip’ as I believe that there is a significant difference between this grip and the shakehands grip I was using for the first 15 years of my career as a player. It’s not that my old grip was inherently wrong (after all, it was never corrected by any coaches) I just feel that the relaxed shakehands grip has a number of benefits that make it more suited to the modern game of table tennis.\nI encourage you to spend some time developing your own version of the relaxed shakehands grip. You want to get comfortable with it before you move on to playing shots. You should practice bouncing and controlling the ball with your shakehands grip. There are loads of coordination drills you can do to work on your ball control while helping your brain to save your grip to memory.\nYour grip is the only connection between your body and your bat. It is worth getting it right!\nAdditional help with your grip…\nTable Tennis University\nis a brilliant resource for online table tennis coaching. They have two FREE video courses aimed at new table tennis players and both cover the topic of grip.\nBasics Mastery – with Tao Li\nIn the Basics Mastery course (which is ordinarily worth $97) a young beginner student is instructed in addition to Coach Li’s demonstrations. The course contains 12 coaching videos covering all of the basics.\nLesson #1\nis an 8-minute video explaining how to correctly hold your racket.

I did a terrible job teaching stance to\nSam\n. For the first month I basically let him stand however he liked and he developed a load of bad habits that he then had to struggle to fix later on.\nThe two key aspects of a good stance is being low and wide. What that means is that you want to get your center of gravity as low as realistically possible and you want your feet to be at least 1.5 shoulder widths apart, perhaps even further. Standing and moving around in this kind of position can feel a little tiring, it’s much easier and more comfortable to stand bolt upright with your feet closer together, but it’s important that you develop the strength needed to maintain this position.\nHere is a video of Ryan Jenkins running through the basic stance.\nAnother term you may of heard is the ‘ready position’. Sometimes stance and ready position are used almost interchangeably. Ready position refers to the generic stance that you might expect to see used by a player receiving serve; feet quite wide apart, knees bent, body crouched, and both arms out in front of you, with the bat in a neutral position.\nIt’s important to have a relaxed stance (actually it’s important to have a relaxed everything in table tennis). Let your upper body muscles relax and your arms and shoulders can even hang forward a bit like a gorilla! Your leg muscles will need to be more engaged and ready to move.\nOne way to achieve this is through deep breathing; breathing from your stomach. Take a big breath in, inflate your lungs, and then let it all out. As you exhale allow your upper body to naturally drop down. You should feel your center of gravity sink, your balance increase, and your core become more solid. From then on maintain your stance and engage in some\nbelly breathing\n. This will help to keep you relaxed and low.\nOnce you understand the basics of stance you can test yourself with some balance and agility drills. A great way to continue drilling in this new stance is to play one-on-one catch games using a table tennis ball with a partner. You could even do some ball control skills in your new stance (for example: hitting a ball against a wall while staying low and relaxed).\nHere’s\na previous article I wrote\non stance and the ready position.\nAdditional help with your stance…\nTom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse covers the topic of stance and is available for FREE at\nTableTennisUniversity\n!\nLecture #3\nis a 7-minute video focused on developing the correct grip. To gain access all you need to do is join Table Tennis University as a FREE member and then enroll in the Table Tennis For Beginners course.\nDay 3 – Footwork\nThe final important aspect to cover before you start hitting balls is your footwork. Many players are taught all the strokes first, from a stationary position, and then footwork and movement is added in further down the line. This seems like a bad idea to me. Table tennis is an active sport where you need to play shots and then move.\nI believe that we would be much better taking a leaf out of boxing’s training methods. Punching is obviously really important in boxing but so is footwork. You need both and they are inextricably linked. That’s why even beginner boxers are taught footwork alongside the basic punches. They don’t start by punching from a standing position, flat-footed, and then try and incorporate footwork once they have learnt the punches. The two go together.\nTable tennis footwork is quite strange. This is because most of the time you don’t need to move very far, all you need to do is make small adjustments with your feet. Watch the video below of Wang Wen Jie (coach on the Swedish club Askims BTK) and you’ll get an idea of what I mean.\nThis is going to feel very unnatural at first as very few other activities require this kind of movement. That is why you have a whole day to work on mastering this type of footwork.\nYou should concentrate on getting comfortable with the side-step footwork first, especially with lots of fast changes of direction. You can practice this going around a table tennis table in circles (if you have one). Then you can move on to faster footwork patterns or trying to cover large distances with one step.\nTable tennis is a very explosive sport and if you look at any of the top players you will notice that they all have massive legs. This kind of movement is hard work!\nI would recommend keeping your bat in your hand while working on your footwork and also remembering to stay in your relaxed and low stance. This will keep you to stay balanced when moving and make the practice more realistic to the experience of actually playing table tennis.\nAdditional help with your footwork…\nTao Li’s\nBasics Mastery\ncourse (available for FREE at\nTableTennisUniversity.com\n) contains a 9-minute training video looking at the side shuffle footwork. You can find that\nhere\n.\nAlso,\nLecture #4\nof Tom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse is specifically focused on teaching the basic movement techniques necessary for table tennis.\nDay 4 – Forehand Drive\nIt’s finally time to start hitting some balls! I know it can be tempting to skip over the first three days and start playing straight away but I would really advise against it. You will pick up\nthe four basic table tennis strokes\nso much faster having spent three days getting really comfortable with your grip, stance and footwork.\nBack in 2012, I wrote the blog post\nHow to Play a Forehand Drive in Table Tennis\n. Since then it has received over 25,000 views. Nothing has changed either. The technique I teach now is pretty much exactly the same as what I was teaching in 2012.\nThe key is to focus on control, consistency and accuracy. I will be saying this many times during the course. Don’t get carried away trying to play too fast or hit the ball really hard. When you are first starting out consistency is king.\nHere’s a video of Coach Tao Li going through most of the basics of the stroke. This video is\nLesson #3\ntaken from Tao’s 12-part “Basics Mastery” table tennis training course – available for FREE at\nTableTennisUniversity.com\n!\nMy one piece of advice would be… don’t over think when you are learning this stroke. You want your forehand drive to be natural and relaxed. If you are consciously thinking about your technique and which parts of your body should be moving where you are going to end up playing like a robot.\nThe key is quantity. You need to rally, rally, rally. After five hours you should have reached a point where you are quite comfortable with the forehand drive. Your target should be to play 100 controlled shots in a row without a mistake. Once you have reached that level you know that the stroke has begun to transfer into your subconscious.\nAdditional help with your forehand drive…\nYou’ve already seen Tao’s forehand drive instruction. For a slightly different perspective, I would recommend checking out\nLecture #5\nof Tom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse.\nDay 5 – Backhand Drive\nSome people find learning\nthe backhand drive\neasier than the forehand drive. Others find it more difficult. The technique is very different so that isn’t surprising.\nThe principle, however, is exactly the same. You want to develop a stroke that is controlled, consistent and accurate. You should be aiming for that 100 shot target and trying to get as comfortable and natural with the technique as possible.\nHere is a video of Ma Long (the current world #1) demonstrating his backhand drive technique. The video includes the forehand and backhand drive. It’s worth watching both but if you just want the backhand drive it starts at 4:09.\nMa Long is an excellent example of the perfect technique for these drive strokes.\nYou may have noticed Ma Long pointing out his use of the thumb on the backhand. Many players have their thumb slightly higher on the rubber for a backhand in order to give more stability to the stroke. This is one of the reasons I favour the relaxed shakehands grip (from Day 1) because the slight pinch technique between the thumb and index finger gives you the ability to use your thumb on the backhand.\nHowever, you don’t want to be having a big grip change between your forehand and backhand strokes. While you can often get away with this in practice and rallying it can really hold you back in match play. While Ma Long does slightly adjust the position of this thumb between forehand and backhand strokes his grip remains pretty much unchanged.\nIf you need more detail check out my blog post\nHow to Play a Backhand Drive\n.\nOnce you feel comfortable with the backhand drive technique you should practice combining the forehand and backhand strokes, both in regular drills (for example; one forehand followed by one backhand) and in random/irregular play.\nAdditional help with your backhand drive…\nTao Li’s\nBasics Mastery\ncourse (available for FREE at\nTableTennisUniversity.com\n) contains two lessons focused on teaching the backhand drive technique. I highly recommend you watch those!\nAlso,\nLecture #6\nof Tom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse features an 8-minute video looking at the backhand drive in detail.\nDay 6 – Backhand Push\nOnce you’ve got the hang of the forehand and backhand drive (your topspin strokes) it’s time to work on the forehand and backhand push (your backspin strokes). You need to be able to play a topspin game and a backspin game. Many recreational players can only do one or the other.\nI like to start with the\nbackhand push\nfirst because it is a much easier stroke to learn. You should be able to pick it up quite quickly and be achieving long rallies almost straight away.\nHere is a video (\nLecture #7\n) from Tom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis for Beginners\ncourse outlining the main coaching points of the backhand push.\nFor a more detailed look at the coaching points and common errors for the backhand push,\nclick here\n.\nYou’ve heard me say it before but I’m going to say it again, focus on control, consistency and accuracy. Try and reach a point where\nyou feel like you could play backhand pushes forever\nwithout ever making a mistake.\nOnce you get to that point it’s time to start thinking about increasing the amount of backspin on your pushes. Most players can push but very few are able to generate heavy backspin on their pushes. This requires you to open up your bat angle, get right underneath the ball, and brush it with a fine contact using a lot of wrist acceleration.\nA good game to play is to play push-to-push with a partner while both of you are trying to put so much backspin on the ball that the other person pushes into the net.\nAt the advanced level players will be trying to keep their pushes super short (or occasionally digging them really deep into the end line) but for now the best use of your time is learning how to generate heavy backspin and keep your consistency high.\nIf you have a heavy backspin push you will also find it much easier later on to develop a\nheavy backspin serve\n.\nDay 7 – Forehand Push\nThe\nforehand push\nis definitely the most difficult of the four basic strokes to learn. It’s just quite an awkward and unnatural motion. The backhand push technique seems to work well with our arm and elbow while the forehand push simply doesn’t.\nYou will probably find it easier and more convenient to play a backhand push up to 75% of the time. You can still play a backhand push to a ball in the middle of the table and even slightly in the forehand half. However, if you receive a backspin ball to your wide forehand you are going to have to play a forehand push… so you better be able to!\nHere is a demonstration from Stefan Feth (Head Coach at the World Champions Table Tennis Academy in California and former German national team player).\nI really like Stefan’s emphasis on making the push spinny, low, fast and long. If you can push in this way then you are turning your push into a weapon (especially at the lower levels of play) instead of just using it to keep the ball on the table.\nHe also talks about making contact at 6 o’clock, meaning that you should try to get completely underneath the ball if you are to generate maximum spin. Plenty of beginners make the mistake of hitting down the back of the ball instead of underneath it. In reality your bat probably won’t be completely horizontal but that is how it should feel in your head when you are playing a good push.\nThe forehand push will require plenty of practice before you start to get the hang of it. Keep going! Avoid the temptation to skip over this because it is difficult. If you are still struggling try and watch a player with a good forehand push. It can be very hard to explain how to push well but you can learn a lot just by watching.\nOnce you’ve got it make sure you spend some time combining the two push shots together in both a regular and random fashion. Once you can do that you have mastered the four basic strokes and can move on the the final stage of training.\nAdditional help with your forehand push…\nLecture #8\nof Tom Lodziak’s\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse features an 8-minute video looking at how to play a forehand push correctly. It’s a tricky stroke to master so I recommend watching as many instructional videos as possible.\nDay 8 – Serve\nThe majority of beginners use a plain serve that has very little spin or a bit of topspin. There isn’t anything wrong with this but you will become a bit predictable if you do the same serve every single time.\nThere are loads of different types of serve in table tennis, some are very complex. You don’t need to worry about the majority of them at this stage. You can also choose whether you prefer serving with your forehand, backhand or a combination of both. Some people find one side easier than the other.\nI believe your best bet is to develop a super heavy backspin serve and a super fast serve. The ‘super’ has been added to point out what is important. Your backspin serve must have as much backspin as possible and your fast serve must be as fast as possible.\nHere are a couple of articles that will help you to master these serves…\nDeveloping a Super Heavy Backspin Serve\nHow to Serve Faster in Table Tennis\nThe ‘ghost serve’ is a particular type of heavy backspin serve where the ball has so much backspin on it that it actually bounces back into the net. You don’t need to worry about that at the moment but the principle of generate a huge amount of backspin is helpful.\nBelow a video of a young player attempting the ghost serve. This first serve isn’t a ‘ghost serve’ because it only bounces twice before dropping off the end of the table. However, this is pretty much what you want to try and do with your heavy backspin serve, so copying that first one is a good idea. The ball stayed pretty low and had plenty of backspin.\nServe like that and an inexperienced opponent will almost certainly put the ball straight into the net. If they have played a bit of table tennis (or work out how to return it) they will start pushing that serve back. That’s OK. You can then get into a pushing rally and out-push them with your consistency, placement and variation.\nAnd here’s an example of the fastest ever table tennis serve by Japanese wonderkid Asuka Sakai.\nWhile you don’t need to attempt to copy this technique you should notice how Asuka is;\nLetting the ball drop very close to table height before making contact.\nHitting the ball very close to the end line on his side of the table.\nThese are two vital ingredients in the recipe for creating a super fast serve. Don’t expect to be serving like Asuka Sakai just yet (he has spent years working on his serves) but master those two points and will be able to serve fast enough to catch out the majority of recreational players and beginners. Especially if you are varying your serves; some fast ones and some with heavy backspin.\nYou will be able to continue working on these two serves during days 9 and 10 so don’t worry if you don’t feel 100% confident with them just yet.\nAdditional help with your serves…\nTao Li has a brilliant premium course called\nService Mastery\navailable for $47 at\nTable Tennis University\n. It teaches the following advanced service techniques;\nForehand serve\nBackhand serve\nForehand pendulum serve\nForehand reverse pendulum serve\nForehand and backhand tomahawk serve\nHigh toss serve\nThe serve is the most important shot in table tennis and this training course has everything you need to master it as fast as possible. Check it out\nhere\n.\nDay 9 – Return of Serve\nReturning serves can be a very tricky business. There are countless combinations of spin, speed and placement that can cause serves to do all sorts of things.\nWhen receiving a serve you typically need to try and work out what type of serve your opponent is using, track the placement of the serve, adjust your positioning, decide on the best possible shot to use to return the serve, and then actually execute your return successfully. This is why the majority of beginners and intermediate players really struggle returning serves. It is often the weakest part of their game and fill them with dread and indecision.\nBut it doesn’t have to be like that!\nThe most important part of returning a serve is working out which type of spin is on the ball. Once you know that you can decide which shot you need to play to return it. If they have put topspin on the serve you need to drive it back. If they have put backspin on the serve you need to push it back. It’s that simple. It all comes down to ‘reading’ the spin on the ball.\nBut what about sidespin?\nMost of the time you can actually just get away with driving a sidespin serve as you would a topspin serve. Aim for the center line and even with plenty of sidespin, the ball should still land on the table. You should be trying to drive your opponent’s serve if you can. This is a more attacking stroke and will put you in a better position for the rally. Only if you see the serve is backspin do you need to think about pushing it.\nAt the beginner level, most players aren’t getting that much spin on their serves. This makes them much easier to return. It is only as you progress and start to come up against stronger players that you need to learn a bit more about reading and returning the different kinds of spin and adjusting your strokes.\nDay 10 – Match Play\nNow it’s time to put everything together into match play. Here is the basic strategy I propose;\nService = You should serve 50% fast and 50% heavy backspin.\nReturn = You should try and play a drive stroke unless the ball has backspin.\nRallying = If the ball is topspin, drive it. If the ball is backspin, push it.\nWinning points = The majority of your points should come from out-rallying your opponent.\nHowever, we all have different strengths and weaknesses and it would be foolish not to adjust your strategy accordingly. You should spend your final day (or five hours) trying different things out in your matches and deciding how you like to play.\nDo you prefer to serve or receive? Why?\nAre you better at drives or pushes?\nAre you stronger with your forehand or your backhand?\nIs your positioning and footwork a strength or a weakness?\nOnce you have a good understanding of your abilities you can tweak my basic strategy and come up with some tactics of your own.\nFor example, if you are better at driving than pushing then you might want to serve 75% super fast and only 25% heavy backspin. If you serve heavy backspin you will likely get stuck in a pushing rally which isn’t ideal if you are weak at pushing. However, it’s still good to serve heavy backspin some of the time.\nOr, if you are much stronger on the forehand than the backhand then you might want to think a bit more carefully about your placement. When rallying you could aim more into your opponent’s forehand and this stops them from having an angle into your wide backhand. When serving fast you might want to avoid going wide to your opponent backhand as in this situation their most likely return would be into your backhand.\nThere are loads of complex match strategies and tactics online but at this stage I would encourage you to stay away from them until you are comfortable with the basics and can beat the majority of other beginners with your consistency. It’s not worth going for risky shots, or trying to play strokes that turn backspin into topspin, at this stage as you will likely make so many unforced errors that your opponent will win off of your mistakes.\nFocus your efforts on improving your consistency and placement so that you can be the one winning off of other’s errors.\nWhat Next?\nFirstly… Congratulations!\nIf you’ve mastered those 10 fundamental aspects of the sport of table tennis you will now be able to play the game competitively. You are still a long way from being an “expert” but you should be able to beat pretty much every non-table tennis player you come up against.\nThe next step for you is to;\nContinue perfecting these 10 fundamental skills (it can take years to attain complete mastery).\nMove on to some of the more advanced table tennis strokes.\nIntroducing… Table Tennis University!\nI hope you’ve managed to enroll in Tao Li’s FREE Basics Mastery course.

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nSeptember 26, 2012\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Rules and Regulations\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Rules and Regulations\nA post entitled Table Tennis Rules and Regulations might sound boring, but it isn’t! At least, I hope it won’t be.\nIn this post, I will clearly explain the most important rules of table tennis and in doing so, put an end to the countless arguments occur each day across the globe.\nIf you are a casual player or a beginner, this post will attempt to expose any and all of the mythical, made-up table tennis rules that crop up on tables the world over. I will also provide a brief bullet point summary of the basic rules of table tennis.\nIf you’re an experienced player I hope that you’ll find this article useful as well. I recently attempted an umpiring exam paper and despite having been playing table tennis for over 10 years… I failed. There are a few odd and hard to understand rules and regulations in table tennis and I’ll be highlighted them and asking for your opinion.\nSo let’s begin…\nTable Tennis Rules: Myth-busters\nDuring the time I’ve been playing and coaching table tennis, I think I’ve heard every made-up rule there is! Here are a few you might hear and why they are nonsense.\n“Don’t you have to serve diagonally in table tennis?”\nNope! In tennis, squash and badminton you must serve diagonally but in table tennis singles you can serve wherever you like. Yes, that includes off the sides of the table, if you can get enough sidespin. In table tennis doubles, you do have to serve diagonally and always from your right-hand half to your opponents right-hand half.\n“The ball hit you, so that’s my point!”\nA common one with the kids in school. Sorry, but if you’ve whacked the ball at me and it didn’t hit the table, then that’s a miss. We’re not playing dodge ball!\n“I thought you were meant to play up to 21? I don’t like playing to 11.”\nIn this case, many of the older players would probably agree with you but the ITTF changed the scoring system from 21-points to 11-points back in 2001. If you play competitively the game will be up to 11, so you might as well get used to it!\n“You can’t hit it around the net!”\nActually, you can. And it can be a pretty hard shot to get back. If you put a ball out really wide, your opponent is well within the rules to return it around the net. This even means that in some cases the ball can just roll on your side of the table and not even bounce! It’s very rare but it does happen. There are numerous videos on YouTube.\n“The ball has to cross the net four times before you start ‘play for serve'”\nI hear arguments about this a lot. ‘Play for serve’ is made-up. In a competitive game, the server is usually decided by a coin toss or picking which hand you think the ball is in. If you really want to ‘play for serve’, then just agree before you start at which point you are allowed to start attacking the rally. However, it’s probably easier just to put the ball under the table and guess which hand it’s in!\nBasic Table Tennis Rules\nI’ve summarised the official (and very long) rules of the ITTF in these basic table tennis rules. These should be all you need to start playing a game.\nService Rules\nThe service must start with the ball in an open palm.\nThis stops you from throwing it up with spin.\nThe ball must be thrown vertically, at least 16 cm.\nThis stops you from serving straight out of your hand and surprising your opponent.\nThe ball must be above and behind the table throughout the serve.\nThis stops you getting any silly angles and gives your opponent a fair chance at returning.\nAfter throwing the ball, the server must get their free arm and hand out of the way.\nThis is to allow the receiver to see the ball.\nThe following video, taken from\nTable Tennis University’s Service Mastery training course\n, is another great summary of the basic table tennis service rules…\nDoubles Rules\nThe service must go diagonally, from the server’s right-hand side to the receivers right-hand side.\nThis stops you from getting the opposing pair tangled up before they’ve even hit a ball.\nA doubles pair must strike the ball alternately.\nThis makes doubles challenging. None of that front court/back court tennis nonsense.\nAt the change of service, the previous receiver becomes the new server and the partner of the previous server becomes the receiver.\nThis makes sure everybody does everything. After eight points you’re back to the start of the cycle.\nGeneral match play\nYou have two serves before it is your opponent’s turn to serve twice.\nThis used to be five serves each but since changing to 11 it’s now just two.\nAt 10-10 it’s deuce. You get one serve each and must win by two clear points.\nThis is sudden death or table tennis’ equivalent of a tie break.\nIf you are playing a best of 3, 5 or 7 (as opposed to just one set) you have to change ends after each game.\nThis makes sure both players experience conditions on both sides of the table. You also change ends when the first player reaches five points in the final game of a match.\nA let is called if…\nAn otherwise good serve touches the net.\nThis ensures your opponent has a chance at making a return.\nThe receiver isn’t ready (and doesn’t try to hit the ball).\nThis is just common sense really!\nIf play is disturbed by something outside of the players’ control.\nThis allows you to replay the point if your cat jumps onto the table, etc.\nA point is lost if…\nThe service is missed.\nThe service is not returned.\nA shot goes into the net.\nA shot goes off the table without touching the court.\nA player moves the table, touches the net or touches the table with their free hand during play.\nOdd Table Tennis Rules\nHere are a few table tennis rules and regulations that surprised me.\nYou are allowed to accidentally ‘double hit’ the ball!\nThe rules state that you lose a point if you\ndeliberately\nstrike the ball twice in succession.\nDid you know this? I think it’s a new rule. What do you think of it?\nYou are allowed a maximum of two advertisements on the back of your shirt, in international competitions.\nI wonder if they ever check to see if players have three?\nI’ve certainly never heard of a player having to change a shirt because they have too many adverts on their back!\nLet me know if you ever see a video with someone wearing three in an international competition.\nThe playing surface of the table can be made of any material.\nAll it has to do is give a uniform bounce of about 23cm when a ball is dropped from 30cm.\nI’m pretty sure they are always made of wood though but I may be wrong.\nThe racket can be any size, shape or weight.\nI’ve seen a few funny home-made bats recently from local league players. One was made of balsa wood and about an inch thick!\nAt the time I thought, “It’s fine here but they wouldn’t get away with that in an actual tournament”.\nWell, apparently they would!\nIf a wheelchair player is playing in an able-bodied tournament their opponents must play ‘wheelchair rules’ against them.\nI came into contact with this rule coaching at Junior British League Qualifiers last summer. I was ensured by the tournament umpires and referees that this was the case and I myself had no idea, so I had to go with it.\nI since discovered that the rules state that wheelchair service/receive rules apply simply, “if the receiver is in a wheelchair”, regardless of who the server is.\nWhether you’re new to the sport or have been playing for years I hope you found that interesting.\nIf you would like to have at look at the official table tennis rules and regulations, in depth, then you can do so on the\nITTF regulations\npage. You can even download a PDF document full of all the table tennis rules you can possibly consume. Did I miss anything important? Either serious or funny. If so, please let me know and I’ll update the post.\nSo, now you know the rules… What next?\nI’m a table tennis coach, not an umpire.

    "title": "The ABCs of Table Tennis",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJuly 6, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nThe ABCs of Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nThe ABCs of Table Tennis\nIf you’ve had experience coaching sport you may have heard of the FUNdamentals of movement or the ABCs of physical literacy. These describe the key skills that underpin the majority of sports; agility, balance and coordination.\nThe theory is that if you can help kids develop these skills at an early age it will help them excel at any sport they later decide to pick up. I believe primary schools in particular are particularly big on this kind of thing at the moment and teaching what they call “multi-skills”.\nFor a brief introduction to what I’m talking about, check out the video below…\nAs a table tennis coach I take this to mean that\na kid with excellent agility, balance and coordination will learn how to play much faster than one without\nthese fundamental skills. I believe that is what they are saying. The agility, balance and coordination will act as a foundation to build the table tennis specific skills on top of and will make kids better at playing the game.\nThat got me thinking…\nWhat if instead of\nhoping\nthat kids turn up at our training sessions with these fundamental skills in place we instead develop a way to actually\nteach\nthem these skills using table tennis? Wouldn’t that be a good use of time in the long run? An investment for the future?\nAnd does it have to do limited to kids? Could adult beginners benefit from this type of fundamental sport and movement training too? After all, there are plenty of adults that struggle with these skills!\nI encountered this first-hand during\nThe Expert in  Year Challenge\nwith Sam. He was the first to admit that he wasn’t naturally ‘sporty’ and lacked the ability to throw a ball correctly or do loads of other basic sporty things. At the beginning of the challenge we tried to ignore it but by the time we reached the second half of the year we realised we should have tackled it from the start.\nI believe that everyone (yes, everyone) could benefit from working on the ABCs of table tennis\nand I’m going to use this blog post to introduce some ideas to you to try out at home or at your next training session.\nI am going to change the order slightly (to balance, coordination, agility) because that makes more sense for progression.\n1. Balance\nYou may believe that good balance is something you either have or you don’t, but that isn’t true. Just like all physical skills balance can be worked on and improved.\nAt the most basic level balance is all about distributing your weight evenly so that you can remain upright and steady. If you have too much weight going forwards, backwards or to either side you will lose balance. You probably take a lot of this for granted, having mastered balancing a long time ago, but it’s worthwhile pointing out that the better you are at balancing the faster you will improve at table tennis.\nTable tennis is an active sport (honest) and therefore we are more interested in dynamic balance than static balance. Dynamic balance is the ability to maintain balance and control of the body whilst moving. In a table tennis match you need to be able to keep your balance as you move to the ball, as this will enable you to play a good shot and move for the next ball.\nHere is a video explaining the importance of balance in table tennis by Wang Wen Jie, coach on the Swedish club Askims BTK.\nSome of the key points he mentions are;\nKeep your body low and in the middle\nYour upper body should be relaxed\nMake sure your feet are in the correct position\nThere are lots of non-table tennis activities and exercises you can do to improve your dynamic balance. It’s worth spending some time on these until you feel really comfortable. You should be able to run, jump, hop on both legs, skip, and do all sorts of combinations of these movements while maintaining balance.\nYou can also do plenty of different shadow play drills to work on your balance (kind of like what Wang Wen Jie was doing in the video). Get used to developing this relaxed playing stance where you are able to quickly move your feet while maintaining balance and control. Perhaps try to shadow play some training routines but have balance as your focus.\nMaster the art of balance early on and you’ll find everything else comes much more naturally. Good dynamic balance is a skill that the ‘naturals’ often have from the start. It’s one of the reasons they make playing table tennis look so easy and improve so quickly.\n2. Coordination\nCoordinated people are good at skills such as throwing and catching, hitting and kicking. They are able to make the right movements at the right time.\nCoordination is crucial to table tennis success. You need to be able to track the ball and then move your body correctly and on time in order to make a stroke. Hitting a table tennis ball may seem simple but in fact it is highly complex. That’s one of the reasons why they haven’t been able to create a machine/robot that can beat a human yet.\nWhether you class yourself as coordinated or uncoordinated really doesn’t matter. If you want to learn how to play table tennis (or improve faster) you need to work on improving your general and table tennis specific coordination as much as possible.\nYou should work on your throwing and catching, especially with table tennis balls. You can also do exercises where you have to kick the table tennis ball. This works on your balance as well as your coordination.\nHere’s a video of some table tennis specific coordination training.\nIt might seem very basic but this is not a waste of time at all. The kids that start playing at 5 or 6 and go on to play internationally all do this kind of thing when they start out. They have coaches that get them to do all of these coordination drills early on and then when they actually start playing they pick it up much faster. If we are learning to play as older children or adults we should give these exercises a try too.\nHere is another example\n. Balancing a balloon on your bat while also trying to dribble a table tennis ball through cones is incredibly difficult. It is working all different parts of your body and giving your brain loads of things to think about and regulate at once.\nIt is a good idea to practice all of these ‘kids’ exercises and games. Bounce the ball on your bat. Play against a wall. Try to run while keeping the ball on your racket. All of these will build your movement fundamentals and help you to improve faster once you begin learning the actual strokes.\nEven if you can already play table tennis at a decent level I’m convinced that experimenting with different spins and patterns just bouncing the ball on your bat is a good use of your time and will transition into a great control and feeling for the ball when you go back on the table.\n3. Agility\nAgility is the most advanced of the three which is why it comes last (even though it begins with A). Skills that come under the umbrella term of agility involve; starting, stopping, changing direction, rotation, reaction, and complex movements.\nTable tennis relies heavily on agility.\nDespite what many people believe, table tennis is not a static sport; far from it. Playing table tennis well requires you to make hundreds of rapid movements and reactions. Top players are constantly getting into position, changing direction and reacting to the ball. The speed of play makes agility one of the most important factors for success. With smashes in excess of 60mph, a player typically has only 0.3 seconds to react.\nHere’s an example of some agility training for table tennis players.\nThe focus here is on speed, rapid change of direction, and keeping the movements as relevant to table tennis as possible. To do this they have kept the distances short and cramped to encourage fast feet.\nI have to admit that during my 15+ years of involvement in table tennis I have done very little agility training. At many clubs this kind of practice is clearly being overlooked. Perhaps ask your coach if they can arrange some agility training for the last 10 minutes of your training session, or organise it yourself. You can buy lots of expensive agility equipment if you like (and some bits are very useful) but you don’t need to. You could simply put things down on the floor to weave in and out of.\nHere is an interesting article\nfrom Rowden Fullen’s site comparing the speed and agility of Asian and European players. It appears Asia is taking agility much more seriously than the rest of the world.\nJust Do It\nIn summary…\nBalance, coordination and agility are the building blocks for all future sporting success and therefore have a direct impact on our table tennis performance.\nBeginners that come into our sport with good balance, coordination and agility will improve faster and see greater results.\nSam\nwas lacking in all of these areas, due to limited experience in other sports, and it showed.\nRecognise the importance of the fundamentals and make sure you find a way to incorporate them into your weekly training."

    "title": "The Four Basic Table Tennis Strokes",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nNovember 16, 2012\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nThe Four Basic Table Tennis Strokes\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nThe Four Basic Table Tennis Strokes\nIn table tennis, as in most sports, it’s paramount to get the technical basics correct. These basic strokes are the foundations that can be built upon as a player improves. It is possible to correct major technical issues at a later stage but it’s much easier to get them right first time around. There are four basic table tennis strokes and I always strive to have my players master these before moving on to more complicated activities.\nIn this post I’ll be going through each of these four basic strokes and giving some tips and coaching points to help you successfully master them yourself or teach them to others. The four shots are;\nForehand drive\nBackhand drive\nBackhand push\nForehand push\nI’ve written about each of the four strokes in more detail in their own post. Just click the links above if you’d like to read those.\nThe order that I have listed them is the order that I teach them in. I always start with the forehand drive as this will probably become the players most used and most important stroke. I then teach the backhand drive so that the players have a good offensive game and can rally with each other before moving on to the more defensive push strokes.\nIMPORTANT:\nIn order to learn these strokes correctly you will need a bat that can generate a good amount of spin. A lot of beginners bats are ‘dead’ and aren’t able to create spin. Learning with a bat like this can have detrimental effects on your game as you learn to compensate for your poor quality bat with an unorthodox technique.\nAn easy way to find out if your bat is dead is to hold a table tennis ball and rub it over the surface of your rubber. If the ball slides across the rubber, with very little resistance, then your bat is probably no good. Can I please point you in the direction of my post,\nThe Best Table Tennis Bat for Beginners\n. It’s a comprehensive guide to buying your first table tennis bat, telling you what to look for and what to avoid!\nPrerequisites\nBefore reading this post, and beginning to learn the basic table tennis strokes, I recommend you first have an understanding of three other table tennis basics…\nThe correct\ntable tennis grip\nThe\nstance and ready position\nwe use in table tennis\nThe basic movement patterns and\ntable tennis footwork\nI always teach these before moving onto strokes and I think it is important to learn table tennis in this order. I know the first thing you want to do when learning a new skill is get stuck in, and in table tennis that means hitting balls, but I believe it’s much better for you, in the long run, to fully understand grip, stance and footwork before you start worrying about strokes.\nI have laid out my manifesto for learning table tennis on the page,\nHow to Play Table Tennis\n. Please\nhave a look. It’s filled with all my best technical coaching articles and will give you the sequence and progression you need to fully develop all the important technical skills of the game.\nOkay, now that you’ve mastered grip, stance and footwork lets look at the four basic table tennis strokes…\nThe Forehand Drive\nI have written a full post on\nhow to play a forehand drive\n, so if you are looking for more detail that is the place to go. Otherwise enjoy this summary.\nI break the forehand drive down into four main parts. The stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish. Get all of these parts correct and you’ll have a pretty good basic forehand drive.\nThe stance\nis the first thing you need to worry about. Make sure this is correct before trying to hit any balls. You’ll want your feet wider than shoulder width apart (some coaches even say two shoulder widths apart). If you’re right handed, then your right foot needs to be slightly further back than your left. About half a step. Knees should be bent. Body crouched (leaning forwards) and weight on the balls of your feet (not your heels). Then put both arms out in front of you and you’re good to go.\nThe backswing\nis the first movement after you’ve seen the ball. Without it your shot will lack power and you’ll struggle to control the ball. The key things you need to remember are, rotating your body  to the right from your hips and shifting your weight onto your back foot. Keep everything else the same as it was in the stance.\nThe strike\nis the forward movement, towards the ball. You basically need to do the opposite of the backswing. Rotate your body to the left/forwards, from your hips. Transfers your weight from your back foot to front foot. Also remember to keep your bat angle slightly closed throughout, to take the ball at the peak of the bounce and keep a small gap between your elbow and body. To give the shot a bit of extra zip, try accelerating your forearm slightly as you make contact. This action is similar to a military salute and will give you a little extra pace and spin.\nThe finish\nis the end point of the shot. It’s important not to over rotate and finish with your bat over your shoulder or behind your neck, like in tennis. Instead, you should finish the forehand drive with your bat pointing where you have hit the ball. From the strike the bat should move forwards and up.  Finally, don’t forget to get back to your ready position so you can play the next shot!\nIf you’d like to see all of that visually, here’s a video of a Coach Tao Li, a professional Chinese table tennis player and coach, teaching the basics of the forehand drive to a young student.\nThis video is Lesson #3 taken from Coach Tao Li’s FREE 12-part\nBasics Mastery\nonline table tennis training course. He created the course to teach the fundamental table tennis skills to players from all over the world.\nTo gain access to the course, all you need to do is join\nTable Tennis University\nas a FREE member and then you will be able to enroll in the\nBasics Mastery\ncourse. There is also a wide selection of other free and premium online table tennis courses for you to check out.\nThe Backhand Drive\nAs with the forehand drive, I break the backhand drive down into four parts. Some players find the backhand drive harder to master. This may be because the ‘backswing’ required is very different, or often they have played other racket sports and already have a wrong technique established, or they may simply have spent a lot less time playing backhand shots in general.\nThe stance\nshould be ‘square to the line of play’. This means that your feet should be facing the direction of play. Usually this will mean your feet will be pointing diagonally towards your opponents backhand corner. Everything else is the same as the forehand drive. Feet slightly wider than shoulder width, body is crouched, arms are out in front of you with a bend at the elbow.\nThe backswing\nfor a backhand does not involve any rotation of the body or weight transfer. Instead, just bring the bat back towards your body. If you are right-handed you will probably want to bring it back so that it is just above your left hip. This is a drive so the bat angle should be slightly closed.\nThe strike\nis pretty simple. Move your bat forwards and up, towards the ball, from your elbow. As a beginner focus on just using your elbow for movement. Common mistakes involve players using too much wrist or trying to play the shot from their shoulder (which lifts the ball). Remember to keep the bat angle closed throughout.\nThe finish\nis the same as the forehand drive. The bat should follow the ball and finish in the direction it has just been hit. Your arm should still have a slight bend in it (not finish completely straight) and just recover to your ready position and anticipate the next shot.\nHere’s another video of Coach Tao Li going through the shot with a young beginner and giving some nice demonstrations himself.\nThis video is Lesson #8 taken from Coach Tao Li’s FREE 12-part\nBasics Mastery\nonline table tennis training course (lesson #9 contains part two). He created the course to teach the fundamental table tennis skills to players from all over the world.\nTo gain access to the course, all you need to do is join\nTable Tennis University\nas a FREE member and then you will be able to enroll in the\nBasics Mastery\ncourse. There is also a wide selection of other free and premium online table tennis courses for you to check out.\nThe Backhand Push\nThe backhand push is arguably the easiest of the four basic table tennis strokes. I teach it immediately after the backhand drive as the stance/ready position needed for the shot is identical.\nThe stance\nis the same as that used for the backhand drive. Feet and body must be square to the line of play.\nThe backswing\nfor the backhand push requires the bat to be brought backwards and slightly upwards, towards the chest. The bat angle will need to be open at about 45 degrees. The elbow will be bent.\nThe strike\nsimply involves ‘pushing’ the bat forwards and down from the elbow. You should strike somewhere between the back and bottom of the ball. It important to ‘brush’ the ball using the rubber rather than ‘tapping’ it with the blade. The bat angle should stay open throughout the shot and you’ll want to make contact at the peak of the bounce or slightly earlier. A common mistake is trying to ‘scoop’ the ball instead of slicing it.\nThe finish\nshould have the bat out in front of you and down towards the table. The angle at the elbow should have opened but the arm should still be slightly bent. The common error with the finish of the push shot is the bat moving across the body to one side when it should follow the ball.\nThe following video shows Cambridge-based table tennis coach Tom Lodziak explaining the backhand push in detail.\nThis video is Lecture #7 taken from Tom Lodziak’s FREE 10-part\nTable Tennis For Beginners\nonline table tennis training course. He created the course to help players to learn basic table tennis skills and improve their practice.\nTo gain access to the course, all you need to do is join\nTable Tennis University\nas a FREE member and then you will be able to enroll in the\nTable Tennis For Beginners\ncourse. There is also a wide selection of other free and premium online table tennis courses for you to explore.\nThe Forehand Push\nThe forehand push is probably the toughest of all the basic table tennis strokes. Certainly in my role as a coach this is the shot I’ve seen beginners struggling with the most. It can feel quite unnatural at first and is made even more difficult if the feed is bad, as it often is if two beginners are playing together.\nThe stance\nneeds to go back to the forehand ready position you used for your forehand drive. If you’re right-handed that means right foot slightly back and then as always, knees bent, body crouched, both arms out in front of you.\nThe backswing\nfor the forehand push is not as extreme as for the drive. The push is a softer shot and therefore requires more feel and less weight transfer/power. However, you will still need a small amount of twisting backwards in preparation. You ‘ll also need an open bat angle, 45 degrees is good, like in the backhand push. Keep a small gap between your elbow and your body.\nThe strike\nrequires you to twist your body forwards with a slight transfer of weight onto your front foot. You may also need to step in with your playing foot if the ball is short. Upon contact with the ball you should be using the brushing action I mentioned earlier and having very soft hands. The elbow may open slightly during the strike to combine with the turning of your body. The bat angle should be open throughout.\nThe finish\nshould leave the bat in front of your body, having followed the line of the ball. As you’re putting backspin on the ball the bat should be down towards the table. The difficulty here is to follow the ball rather than swiping across your body. If your bat is finishing over to your left-hand side you may need to get your elbow slightly further forward during the strike. A tucked in elbow can lead you to swipe across the ball.\nHere’s another video by Tom Lodziak, this time breaking down how to play the forehand push.\nThis video is Lecture #8 taken from Tom Lodziak’s FREE 10-part\nTable Tennis For Beginners\nonline table tennis training course.

    "title": "Table Tennis Grip – Shakehand",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJanuary 29, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Grip – Shakehand\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Grip - Shakehand\nWhen I’m given a new group of beginners, before I start teaching any strokes, I always go over the basics of table tennis grip and how to hold the bat correctly. It’s very important that you master this early on as it is a slow and painful process trying to alter you grip later in your development.\nIf you’re a beginner, well done for acknowledging the importance of a correct grip at this early stage of your table tennis. If you are reading this as a non-beginner, and realise that your grip is less that ideal, spend the time trying to correct it. Yes, it may make your shots slightly worse now but you’ll reap the rewards later on.\nIt’s worth pointing out that I’ll be talking about the shake-hands grip in this post. I may spend some time looking at the pen-hold grip in another post but to be honest it’s a grip that I know very little about.\nI’ve taken a number of photos to highlight the characteristics of good and bad grip. I hope that this will help you to understand the important differences and ‘self-correct’ if you notice your own grip altering.\nWhat does a correct table tennis grip look like?\nA correct shake-hands table tennis grip should have…\nYour index finger on the backhand rubber.\nYour thumb tucked in on the forehand side.\nThe other three fingers loosely wrapped around the handle.\nLittle to no gap between the top of the handle and your hand.\nThe ‘V’ or crease of your hand in line with the edge of the bat.\nA lot of beginners try to play with two fingers on the bat, or not fingers (hammer grip). Some put their thumb up on the forehand rubber, others don’t wrap their fingers around the handle properly. Many have too big a gap between their hand and the top of the handle. I always emphasise that you should ‘shuffle/slide’ your hand up the handle until it reaches the top and then hold that grip loosely. These four points are relatively easy to enforce and you should be able to work out if you’re doing something wrong.\nPoint number five, that “the ‘V’ or crease of your hand should be in line with the edge of the bat” is the one that needs the most tweaking. This is really the job of your coach but I’ve made the photo below to help you identify any possible grip errors you may be having there.\nIt really all comes down to the location of the ‘V’ or crease in your hand! The correct grip has that crease directly in line with the edge of the bat. The backhand grip shifts that part of your hand round to the forehand side. As the thumb comes up and the hand slides around, the crease or ‘V’ is left on the forehand side. The forehand grip does the opposite. The the hand moves around the bat (the other way) the crease comes unto the backhand side.\nWhat’s wrong with having a forehand or backhand grip?\nPlayers that use these forehand or backhand-centred grips usually experience one of two problems;\nSome stick with one grip and end up with one good wing (depending on which grip they have used) and one poor wing. For example, having a backhand grip will give you the ability to have lots of control, because your thumb is on the bat, and develop a very wristy shot, because your grip has freed up your wrist to move. However, you will normally struggle to play a solid forehand, you’ll have a tendency to ‘hook’ the ball, or drop your wrist slightly.\nOthers decide that they should switch between the two giving themselves the best of both worlds. This will often work in practice or at a level level when you have time to anticipate the ball and change your grip. Unfortunately, at a higher level you will realise that there just really isn’t the time to be worrying about changing grip in the middle of rallies and your reliance on changing grip will turn you into a weak player.\nFinal points\nHere are a few final points to consider when thinking about your grip;\nTry to sort it out early, as a beginner, if you can but, if necessary, be prepared to move backwards slightly now in order to improve more in the future.\nKeep a nice soft loose grip on the handle of the bat.\nThe tip of your index finger should, ideally, be on the backhand rubber (as opposed to sticking off the edge of the bat). This will give you a bit more control on your forehand.\nFollow the tips mentioned above for an orthodox grip and then stick with it. Try to avoid changing grip during rallies.\nUse the photo below to check where your ‘V’ or crease is. This is probably the area where you are most likely to have problems.\nRemember, everyone has a slightly different hand and a slightly different grip. Don’t get too hung up on if your grip is ‘perfect’ or not. Just make sure it’s not significantly poor in a way that will affect your game. You should feel comfortable and confident with your grip.\nI hope you’ve found that useful. It is definitely worth spending a bit of time checking your grip to make sure you don’t have any serious problems with it. If you would like even more advice on how to hold your table tennis bat, watch this video ‘Get a Grip’ by Alois Rosario of PingSkills."

    "title": "Table Tennis Stance and Ready Position (with Fan Zhendong)",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nNovember 15, 2019\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Stance and Ready Position (with Fan Zhendong)\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Stance and Ready Position (with Fan Zhendong)\nTable tennis stance is the second aspect of table tennis technique that I teach to my players. The first is the correct\nshakehands table tennis grip\n.\nThis post is part of my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\nseries. Today we’ll be whizzing through how to stand, where to stand, and why. And we’ll be using the great Fan Zhendong as our example!\nBefore I start, I want to clarify the difference between “stance” and “ready position”. You may have heard people use both terms almost interchangeably, but here’s how I define the two;\nReady position\ndescribes the generic, neutral stance that you might expect to see adopted by a table tennis player before they receive serve – feet quite wide apart, knees bent, upper body crouched forward, both arms out in front of you, and the bat in a neutral position. The ready position doesn’t change. If I say “ready position”, that is always what I want to see.\nStance\ndescribes the way in which a player is standing during any stage of a game. For example, when serving there are correct and incorrect stances that are specific to each individual service. Therefore, the correct stance is dependent on the stroke being played. You don’t want to play a forehand loop with the stance you’d use for touching a short ball to your forehand!\nUnfortunately, I don’t have the time or the space to describe one-by-one the correct stance for all the possible strokes and serves. In this post, I’m going to focus specifically on the correct ready position and helping you to improve your generic table tennis stance.\nThis article was originally published in March 2013 but was updated in November 2019.\nContents\nTable Tennis Ready Position\n1. Feet\n2. Knees\n3. Upper Body\n4. Arms\n5. Bat\nTable Tennis Stance\n“Pretend you’re a goalkeeper!”\n“A goalkeeper with a Zimmer frame!”\nUpper Body: Zimmer Frame\nReady Position vs Stance\nWhere to stand\nHave your bat in the centre\nTable Tennis Ready Position\nThis might sound super basic but you’d be surprised how many experienced table tennis players have fundamental problems with their table tennis stance!\nHere’s a quick tip. Don’t play standing bolt upright as if you’re waiting for a bus!\nThe table tennis ready position has five key components.\n1. Feet\nYou need quite a wide base when playing table tennis. From my experience beginners are far more likely to have their feet too close together than too far apart.\nSome coaches say feet should be parallel to each other and one shoulder-width apart. But I would go further than that and say that your feet should be somewhere between 1.5 and 2 shoulder-widths apart\n– like Fan Zhendong!\nHaving your feet wider apart will give you a more stable base, help you to move, lower your centre of gravity, get you down closer to table height, and enable you to transfer your weight from foot-to-foot to develop power.\nAlso, it’s a good idea to have your non-playing foot slightly further forward than your playing foot. For example, a right-hander would have their left foot slightly in front of their right\n– making them not 100% square to the table.\n2.\nKnees\nIf your legs are completely straight, you will find yourself constantly off and unable to move to wide balls. Therefore, your knees should always be slightly bent – like Fan (above).\nDon’t bend your knees too much and make sure you don’t have them bent in a squat position either. A slight bend is all you need.\n3. Upper\nBody\nWhen playing table tennis your body should be crouched. This means that your head and shoulders are forward and slightly down. It’s also why Fan Zhendong always looks like he doesn’t have a neck in photos!\nThis forward-leaning ‘crouch position’ will stop you from entering into a ‘squat position’ and will shift your weight onto your toes (the balls of your feet) which will make it much easier to move. That would be poor form for a squat but it’s great form for table tennis.\nThis crouched forward position should also stop you from drifting away from the table as you play your shots. This is a common problem for players that have their weight on their heels.\n4.\nArms\nYour arms should be out in front of your body, and forearms parallel with the ground (again, like Fan). This both helps with the crouched/leaning forwards stance and also makes it much easier to play your shots.\nOne thing I’m always banging on about is keeping your elbows out in front of your body. I see many beginners playing with their elbows back and “tucked in” against their sides. This is not good technique. It will almost halve your ‘reach’ for wide balls and destroy your chance of ever playing a powerful shot.\nFinally, most players try and keep their free arm parallel with their playing arm, for balance.\n5.\nBat\nThe bat/hand/wrist is the final component of a correct ready position. We always assume that we do not know where the ball is going (even if we are doing a regular exercise) and therefore we keep our bat in a neutral position – pointing the top edge of the racket towards our opponent. That way it is possible for us to play either a backhand or a forehand, on-demand.\nYou want your bat to be an extension of your forearm – not angled up or down. In order to make that happen, you need to keep your wrist straight but allow the weight of the bat to drop it down. This is best explained with a photo.\nYou see how Fan Zhendong’s wrist isn’t bent in or out but he has allowed it to drop slightly so that his bat is in a horizontal position. If he had kept his wrist up the bat would be going up at roughly a 45-degree angle and would no longer be an extension of his forearm.\nFor more help regarding this, you need to check out my blog post all about\ntable tennis grip\n.\nTable Tennis Stance\nAs I said at the beginning, this article is all about helping you to improve your generic table tennis stance. I often call this your “shape”. I’ll say to my players, “Keep your shape”, when I notice them slipping out of a correct stance in whatever way.\nAnd sometimes it’s easier to grasp that correct “shape” by using an image or analogy rather than with detailed instructions for each part of the body.\n“Pretend you’re a goalkeeper!”\nWhenever I see a player with an unhelpful stance often all I need to say is…\nPretend you’re a goalkeeper ready to receive a penalty.\n…and, provided the player has at least some simple knowledge of football, they tend to immediately get into a much better stance for table tennis.\nYou’d be surprised how similar the two stances are! The following is taken from\nSoccer Coach Weekly\n…\nThe ready position is the position that goalkeepers need to adopt as they prepare to stop a shot… Feet shoulder width apart. Knees slightly bent. Weight on the balls of the feet. Hands at waist height. Elbows tucked in. Shoulders forward (nose over toes). Balanced. Head steady, eyes on the ball.\nReplace the word “goalkeeper” with “table tennis player” and that could be straight out of a table tennis coaching manual!\nThe goalkeeper analogy usually fixes #1 and #2 – feet and knees (the lower body). The only problem is, it doesn’t correct #3, #4 or #5 – upper body, arms and bat.\nI noticed this recently when I was training Harrie. Most of the time; his back is straight, his shoulders are back, and his bat is down.\nSo I came up with this instead. Pretend you’re a goalkeeper…\n“A goalkeeper with a Zimmer frame!”\nUpper Body: Zimmer Frame\nReady Position vs Stance\nIt’s important to remember the difference between ready position and stance. The ready position is the basics but sometimes stance will have to be changed for certain shots. For example, if you are ‘opening up’ and topspinning a backspin ball with your forehand you may start in the neutral ready position but very quickly your stance will have to be adapted. You might need your feet slightly wider, your right knee slightly more bent and your right arm and bat closer to the ground.\nHowever, the general principles are the same. If your weight is on your heel something has probably gone wrong. If your back is straight, or your elbows glued to your sides or your knees bent in a ‘squat position’ your technique is probably not quite correct.\nHere’s a great video of Alois from Ping Skills going through the key components of the basic stance and explaining all about balance and stability.\nWhere to stand\nI’ve spent a lot of time covering “how” to stand. Before we wrap up, let’s briefly think about “where” to stand (in relation to the table). Here are a few tips…\nHave your bat in the centre\nOnce you start playing table tennis you will realise, quite quickly, that you can reach much further on your forehand side than your backhand side. Therefore, standing completely in the centre of the table is a bad idea.\nInstead, look to have your bat in line with the centre of the table. If you’re right-handed, this will mean standing slightly left of centre. If you’re left-handed, this will mean standing slightly to the right.\nGive yourself some space\nAnother common error I see in beginners is standing way too close to the table. Some even have there legs touching the edge of it! Standing this close gives you little time to react to shot, makes it difficult to move, and often leads to you standing upright (instead of being in the correct “crouched” position). Take half a step back. Not too far, as this will make shots harder to play accurately but just enough to give yourself a bit of room.\nHere’s a great video on ready position by Stephen Foster for AllAboutTableTennis. He covers ‘where to stand’ as well as ‘how to stand’ in a good amount of detail.\nAnd that’s everything you need to know about table tennis stance and the ready position!"

It is also Day 4 of my\nHow to Play Table Tennis in 10 Days\ncourse (following grip, stance and footwork).\nOnce mastered, the forehand drive will become one of your most used table tennis shots. It forms the basis for more advanced strokes such as the block, the loop and the counter loop, so it’s really important to develop a strong and consistent stroke.\nThis post will highlight the correct technique for playing a forehand drive in table tennis. I will use my own knowledge as a table tennis coach and a video featuring Head Table Tennis Coach at Greenhouse Charity, Jason Sugrue.\nWhat Is The Forehand Drive?\nThe forehand drive is one of\nthe four basic table tennis strokes\n. The other three are the backhand drive, backhand push and forehand push.\nThe forehand drive is an attacking stroke played with a small amount of topspin. It is a drive shot and not a topspin loop!\nThe forehand drive is played against long or medium length topspin or float balls. You can’t play a forehand drive off a short ball (that would be a flick) and you can’t play a forehand drive off a backspin ball (that would go into the net).\nThe forehand drive is usually played from the forehand side but players are also encouraged to use their forehand drive against balls that come to their middle. Advanced players will even sometimes move around to play a forehand drive from their backhand side, if they see the ball early enough!\nJason Sugrue’s Video\nHere is a really good video going through some of the key points for the forehand drive. There are a few things it doesn’t mention, such as weight transfer, but overall it does a great job for a two minute video.\nMy Coaching Points\nHere are my key coaching points. I’ve tried to go into a bit more detail than the video. I break the forehand drive down into four sections; the stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish.\nThe Stance\nFeet should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart.\nIf right-handed, the right foot should be slightly further back than the left.\nKnees should be slightly bent.\nBody should be leaning forward.\nBoth arms should be out in front of you.\nAbout a 90-110 degree bend at the elbow.\nStand quite close to the table, an arms length away.\nWeight distributed on both feet and on the balls/toes, not heels.\nThe Backswing\nRotate your body to the right, from your hips.\nElbow and bat rotate back with you.\nBat angle closes.\nWeight shifts onto the back foot, right foot for a right-handed player.\nThe body is moving the arm, not the other way round!\nThe Strike\nHips and shoulders rotate forwards to meet the ball.\nThe arm moves forward with the body.\nAccelerate the forearm slightly as you make contact, similar to doing a military salute.\nWeight transfers to the front foot, left foot.\nBat angle stays closed throughout the shot.\nTake the ball at the peak of the bounce and out in front of you.\nKeep a small gap between the elbow and the body.\nThe Finish\nFollow through, forward and upward.\nYour bat should finish roughly pointing where you have hit the ball.\nAlways get back to the ready position.\nCommon Errors\nHere are some common errors to look out for in your own shot.\nEnsure your weight is moving from back foot to front foot during the strike\n. Some players end up with their upper body moving forwards while their lower body moves backwards.\nRotate from your hips not your shoulders\n. The forehand drive should come from the hips. You will sometimes see players twisting back their shoulders and not moving their hips. They will look a bit like a robot playing the stroke. The lower part of your body is very important.\nKeep a gap between your elbows and body.\nA common mistake is tucking the elbows into the body, giving a very limited rotation and later on, little power.\nLet your body move your arm.\nBeginners will often swing their arm at the ball without moving their body at all. A correct forehand drive should have the rotation of the body moving the arm. The power will come from the body and good weight transfer. The arm is just for control.\nKeep your wrist relatively straight.\nSome players drop their wrist through the forehand drive so that the racket is facing downwards. This makes the shot harder to control and usually softer.\nFinish the shot with the bat pointing where you hit the ball.\nMany players over rotate and end up with the bat across their body or over their neck. This is fine is other racket sports such as tennis but not in table tennis. You should accelerate on contact with the ball and then make a solid finish with the bat out in front of you.\nTake the ball at the peak of the bounce.\nIt may seem easier to wait for the ball to drop slightly before making contact but this is not a drive. On some topspin loop shots our contact point is lower but the drive is always peak of the bounce, over the table.\nKeep the bat angle closed throughout the stroke.\nDon’t try to change the angle of the bat during the shot. Some players start with a neutral bat angle and try to close it after the backswing as they strike the ball. This is not a good technique.\nAnd that’s everything you need to know in order to master the forehand drive!\nI have spent the last few years coaching thousands of children the forehand drive in group sessions and individually, and it is usually the ones that are best at listening that make the biggest improvements. There’s a lot to take in!\nTry to add one point at a time to your technique to combat any brain overload. Once you have made an improvement there, add another pointer. There’s no rush and learning in this way will increase your ability to remember the key tips.\nIf you’ve enjoyed this article please check out my\nHow to Play Table Tennis in 10 Days\ncourse, which goes through the 10 fundamental table tennis skills you’ll need to master in order to play the game correctly."

It is a very important shot that allows you to control rallies, return opponents attacks and step on the offensive yourself. If you fail to learn the backhand drive you will find it much harder later on when you try to block with your backhand or play a more aggressive topspin stroke.\nThe backhand drive is probably a slightly easier shot than the forehand drive. This is largely because the backhand drive does not require the body rotation and weight transfer of the forehand drive. However, it is often under-practiced, with players preferring to work on their forehand drive, and as such many beginners lack a consistent backhand drive.\nThis post will highlight the correct technique for playing a backhand drive in table tennis. I will use my own knowledge as a table tennis coach and a video featuring Head Table Tennis Coach at Greenhouse Charity, Jason Sugrue.\nWhat Is The Backhand Drive?\nThe backhand drive is one of the four basic table tennis strokes. The other three are the forehand drive, backhand push and forehand push.\nThe backhand drive is an attacking stroke played with a small amount of topspin. It is a drive shot and not a topspin loop!\nThe backhand drive is played against long or medium length topspin or float balls. You can’t play a backhand drive off a short ball (that would be a flick) and you can’t play a backhand drive off a backspin ball (that would go into the net).\nThe backhand drive is primarily played from the backhand side. Players are generally not encouraged to play backhand shots from their forehand side as this can lead to poor technique and their forehand is usually stronger.\nJason Sugrue’s Video\nHere is a really good video going through some of the key points for the backhand drive. Watch it a couple of times and then have a read of my coaching points and common errors for more information.\nMy Coaching Points\nHere are my key coaching points. I’ve tried to go into a bit more detail than the video. I break the backhand drive down into four sections; the stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish.\nThe Stance\nFeet should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart.\nStance is “square to the line of play”, basically your feet should be pointing in the direction you are hitting the ball.\nKnees should be slightly bent.\nBody should be leaning forward.\nBoth arms should be out in front of you.\nAbout a 90-110 degree bend at the elbow.\nStand quite close to the table, an arms length away.\nWeight distributed on both feet and on the balls/toes, not heels.\nThe Backswing\nBring your bat backwards and down to somewhere just in front of your belly button.\nCreate a slightly closed bat angle.\nKeep your wrist straight\nThe backhand rubber should be pointing in the direction you wish to play.\nThe Strike\nThe arm moves forwards, to meet the ball, and slightly up, to create a bit of topspin.\nThe movement comes predominantly from the elbow and forearm.\nBat angle stays closed throughout the shot.\nTake the ball at the peak of the bounce and out in front of you.\nKeep a small gap between the elbow and the body.\nThe Finish\nFollow through, forward and upward.\nYour bat should finish pointing where you have hit the ball, roughly at about chin level.\nDon’t let your arms swing across your body too much to the right.\nAlways get back to the ready position.\nCommon Errors\nHere are some common errors to look out for in your own shot.\nThe shot should come predominantly from the elbow and forearm.\nSome players play predominantly from the wrist (with the wrist moving across to the right) which leads to a lack of power, poor control, and often a bit of sidespin on the ball. Other players play predominantly from the shoulder (lifting their whole arm to play the shot). This leads to a lack of feeling, a slow shot, and often a lack of spin altogether as they “lift” the ball instead of drive.\nIt should still be quite a long shot.\nThe video said that the backhand drive is a short stroke, which is true. However, from my experience beginners tend to play their backhand drive too short rather than too long. They “poke” and “prod” at the ball instead of playing a full stroke. When you are learning, elongate the stroke to ensure you are starting with a backswing and finishing forwards and coming up to get a bit of topspin. It can then be shortened and made more efficient once you have mastered it.\nFollow the ball with your bat.\nCheck the direction your bat is moving after you’ve made contact with the ball. Often beginners will find that they are moving their bat over to the right in a sort of “car windscreen wiper action”. Alternatively, some players play a sort of “slice” backhand and their arm lunges across their body to the left. Try and make sure you are hitting the back of the ball and your bat follows through in the direction of the shot.\nTake the ball at the peak of the bounce.\nIn the forehand drive beginners are often tempted to take the ball too late. In the backhand drive I generally see the opposite, as players try and take the backhand drive too early, almost off the bounce. Let the ball rise, wait that split second more, and take it nice and high.\nStand directly behind the incoming ball.\nIf you’ve players tennis (or other racket sports) you’ll be aware that they usually reach and take their backhand shots wide of their body. In table tennis we do this on the forehand but not the backhand. You need to get behind the ball. One easy way to think about this is this; if you miss the shot the ball should hit you in the center of your chest, it should not go flying past you. If you were standing in the correct position and missed the ball it would hit your chest.\nKeep the bat angle closed throughout.\nIt can be tempting to open-up the angle of the bat during the strike and follow-through but don’t do this. This is especially common if you are playing the shot from your shoulder and lift your whole arm (or if you’re playing with a dead bat). Keep the bat angle closed throughout the shot and ideally keep your elbow at pretty much the same height. If your elbow is moving upwards a lot during your backhand there is probably something wrong.\nI hope that’s given you all the key coaching points you need for the backhand drive. I have coached this shot to hundreds of players over the last few years and there is usually just one pointer they need to change in order to be playing a good shot. This post should have helped you identify that pointer.\nThere’s a lot to take in when learning a new shot so try to add one point at a time to your technique to combat any brain overload. Once you have made an improvement there, add another pointer. There’s no rush and learning in this way will increase your ability to remember the key tips.\nIf you’ve enjoyed this article please leave me a comment or share this with a friend.

A push is more of a defensive shot than the drive and the aim is to play down the back and underneath the ball to create some backspin, making it more difficult for our opponent to attack the ball.\nOnce mastered the backhand push becomes the foundations for the backhand touch, dig and chop. Having a strong, spinny backhand push will also help you to learn a spinny backhand serve.\nUnlike the forehand strokes, the backhand push doesn’t really quire any movement from the body. All you need to do is get yourself behind the ball and then you can use your arms to play the stroke.\nThis post will highlight the correct technique for playing a backhand push in table tennis. I will use my own knowledge as a table tennis coach and a video featuring Alois and Jeff from PingSkills.\nWhat Is The Backhand Push?\nThe backhand push is one of the four basic table tennis strokes. The other three are the\nforehand drive\n,\nbackhand drive\nand\nforehand push\n.\nThe backhand push is a defensive stroke played with a small amount of backspin.\nThe backhand push is usually played against short and low, backspin or float balls, although beginners that have not developed a loop (or open up shot) can play a push off a longer ball. At the intermediate stage any long balls should be attacked and any balls that are short but high should be flicked or hit.\nThe backhand push is primarily played from the backhand side of the table. Only rarely will a player play a backhand push from their forehand side.\nPingSkills’ Video\nHere is a really good video going through some of the key points for the backhand push. Have a watch and then you may find the coaching tips and common errors I’ve described below helpful for a bit of extra insight.\nMy Coaching Points\nHere are my key coaching points. I’ve tried to go into a bit more detail than the video. As always, I break the forehand push down into four sections; the stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish.\nThe Stance\nFeet should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart.\nStance is ideally square to the line of play (like the backhand drive) but you can usually get away with a square to the table stance as well.\nKnees should be slightly bent and the body should be leaning forward. You may want to be slightly lower for a push as usually we play this shot against lower, backspin balls.\nBoth arms should be out in front of you.\nAbout a 90-110 degree bend at the elbow.\nStand quite close to the table, an arms length away.\nWeight distributed on both feet and on the balls/toes, not heels.\nThe Backswing\nBring your bat backwards, towards your chest\nCreate a slightly open bat angle.\nKeep your wrist straight.\nThe angle at your elbow will be quite closed.\nThe Strike\nThe shot is played directly in front of the body.\nThe arm moves forwards, to meet the ball.\nThe movement comes predominantly from the elbow.\nThe bat angle stays open throughout the shot.\nTake the ball at the peak of the bounce (or slightly earlier) and out in front of you.\nTo get less spin you can play slightly more down the back of the ball.\nTo generate slightly more spin you can play more underneath the ball with a “brushing” action.\nThe Finish\nFollow through forwards, towards the net.\nYour bat should finish pointing where you have hit the ball.\nDon’t let your arm swing across your body to the right.\nYou will likely have also played downwards slightly, so the bat will be closer to the table now than it was during the backswing or strike phases.\nAlways get back to the ready position.\nCommon Errors\nHere are some common errors to look out for in your own shot.\nOverextending the arm.\nThe forehand push should be played with a relatively bent arm throughout the stroke. Overextending the arm is a common error among beginners that are playing the stroke in front of their body. They lunge their arm directly at the ball and finish with a straight elbow. It is very hard to control the ball like this. If you look at Jeff’s technique in the video you’ll see that his arm is never straight at the finish position.\nSwiping across yourself.\nAs with the forehand push, swiping across your body is a common problem with beginners backhand push strokes. If your bat is finishing on your right hand side instead of following the ball then you are probably swiping across yourself. Focus on creating a more forwards movement from your elbow. Occasionally players also make the mistake of slicing across and finishing on the left side of their body but this is less common.\nToo much wrist.\nAt an intermediate and advanced level the wrist can be added to the push to generate a little more spin. However, when first learning the shot you should concentrate on the movement of the arm. Worry about the big bits first and the smaller bits (such as the wrist) can be easily added on later. Start with the wrist and it’s quite hard/more difficult to add bigger movements (such as the correct forearm movement) later on.\nDon’t ‘poke’ or ‘prod’.\nAs I said with the forehand push avoid the temptation to play short, sharp strokes. Learn to play a smooth backhand push stroke with lots of feeling and control. As Alois said in the video it should be a soft and controlled stroke.\nTaking the ball too early.\nIt is difficult to take the backhand push too late as the ball in coming directly at your body. However, some players to try and reach forward too much too take the ball too early. Let the ball come to you and take it either at, or just before, the peak of the bounce. When we look at the backhand touch later on we’ll begin to think about the advantages of taking the ball earlier.\nDon’t ‘scoop’ the ball.\nMany beginners play a “scoop” push where the try and go down the back of the ball and then continue to move up the front of the ball, with the bat finishing high. It follows a U-shape. This is not correct and will stop you from generating backspin. Concentrate on brushing the ball in just one straight line. Your bat should be finishing quite close the table as it will be travelling down slightly during the stroke.\nHopefully now you should be able to go out and play a decent backhand push. Go out and get lots of practice and maybe even check out some of the other instructional backhand push videos on YouTube.\nThis shot is the final part of Level 1 Table Tennis in my\nHow to Play Table Tennis Series\n. Before moving on to level two make sure you have a correct grip and stance/ready position and that you can play 100 forehand and backhand drives and 100 forehand and backhand pushes without a mistake. You may need to find a higher standard practice partner that is able to consistently and accurately keep the ball on the table to practice this.\nNow it’s time for Level 2\nLevel 2 begins to apply the basic strokes we have learnt here to some regular movement exercises. Up to this point you haven’t had to move your feet very much but that is all about to change! I’ve got six hand selected regular movement exercises for you to try out in Level 2 that will cover all of the basic movement patterns you will need to learn. It’s also a great chance to really drill in the correct technique for the basic shots.\nSo, get over there now and start level 2 today!\nIf you would like to subscribe to the\nExpert Table Tennis RSS feed\nand receive updates of new articles then the link is\nhere\n.\nAnd of course make sure you head over to my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\npage for all the other technical training you’ll need to develop from a beginner to a pro."

However, do this for your forehand shots and you’ll be in trouble. Check to make sure the angle of your elbow is pointing your forearm to the side of your body. It can feel a little unnatural at first. It is similar to a fencing position (if you can imagine that).\nOverextending the arm.\nThe forehand push should be played with a relatively bent arm throughout the stroke. Overextending the arm is a common error among beginners that are playing the stroke in front of their body. They lunge their arm directly at the ball and finish with a straight elbow. It is very hard to control the ball like this.\nSwiping across yourself.\nThis is another common error caused by playing the forehand push in front of your body. Some players lunge forwards (the direction of movement is correct but the movement is incorrect), as mentioned in point two, others will swipe across their body (the movement is correct but the direction of movement is incorrect).\nNot using the natural rotation of the body.\nAs with the forehand drive, the forehand push requires a small amount of rotation from the hips, torso and shoulders. If you think about it this is the natural way to play but often beginners end up looking like robots because they are too stiff. Relax and allow your body to turn with the stroke.\nToo much wrist.\nAt an intermediate and advanced level the wrist can be added to the push to generate a little more spin. However, when first learning the shot concentrate on the rotation of the body and the movement of the arm. Worry about the big bits first and the smaller bits (such as the wrist) can be easily added on later. Start with the wrist and it’s quite hard/more difficult to add bigger movements (such as the correct forearm movement) later on.\nDon’t ‘poke’ or ‘prod’.\nAs I said with the backhand push avoid the temptation to play short, sharp strokes. Learn to play a smooth forehand push stroke with lots of feeling and control.\nTaking the ball too late.\nEither taking the ball after the peak of the bounce or trying to take it in line with or behind your body will make the stroke very difficult. Strike the ball at the peak of the bounce or slightly before (when it is still on it’s way up) and make sure the contact point is in front of the body.\nDon’t ‘scoop’ the ball.\nMany beginners play a “scoop” push where the try and go down the back of the ball and then continue to move up the front of the ball, with the bat finishing high. It follows a U-shape. This is not correct and will stop you from generating backspin. Concentrate on brushing the ball in just one straight line. Your bat should be finishing quite close the table as it will be travelling down slightly during the stroke.\nThat should be everything you need to know to play a correct forehand push. As I said before it’s probably the most difficult of the four basic strokes but it’s well worth mastering early on. Avoid the temptation to move on to serves and topspins before you’ve learnt the pushes!\nThere are lot of other great videos on YouTube showing the forehand push in action so definitely have a look at them if you require further help or drop me a line/leave a comment. I’d be happy to help.\nIf you would like to subscribe to the\nExpert Table Tennis RSS feed\nand receive updates of new articles then the link is\nhere\n.\nAnd of course make sure you head over to my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\npage for all the other technical training you’ll need to develop from a beginner to a pro."

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMay 15, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nDeveloping a Super Heavy Backspin Serve\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nDeveloping a Super Heavy Backspin Serve\nIf you are a beginner, or fairly new to table tennis, learning a couple of ‘good’ serves can make all the difference in your matches. A super heavy backspin serve could easily be the difference between winning and losing a game against other players at your own level.\nThis is certainly what Sam discovered a couple of months into\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\n. Once he mastered the ability to really chisel underneath the ball, generating a huge amount of spin, his matches against his flatmates changed completely. In this post I’ll teach you everything you need to know in order to develop a super heavy backspin serve\nMost beginners add very little spin to their serves. Common beginner serves include a fast flat serve or various combination of light sidespin and topspin. These serves can be hit by the receiver and returned with a drive, counter-hit, smash, slap, whatever you want to call it.\nThe only way to win the point with these kinds of serves is to;\nServe fast enough to catch your opponent off guard (this is very hard to do as all they need to do is stick their bat in the way of the ball to return it).\nPlay the point out and beat them in the rally (this is a perfectly acceptable way to win points but it could be so much easier).\nIf you are playing a half decent beginner, confident at hitting the ball hard, you can actually end up on the back foot after these types of serves. You are essentially giving them a free ball to hit and putting pressure on yourself to be able to get to their quick return of your serve.\nSo what else can you do?\nVery few beginners are able to serve with heavy backspin. Learn this skill and you will find yourself in a unique position against your peers.\nIf you watch professional table tennis players you’ll notice that the majority of their serves are backspin and short. That is because this is the most difficult type of serve to attack and at the highest levels you don’t want to give your opponent any free balls to hit.\nMany beginners decide to try and replicate these serves and start trying to serve short backspin. Sounds like a good idea, right?\nWrong!\nUnfortunately, learning how to serve short backspin is very difficult when you haven’t fully got to grip with simply serving heavy backspin. The desire to keep the ball short (bouncing twice on your opponents side of the table) usually ends up making it incredibly difficult for a beginner to actually put any spin on the ball. They are left with a short float serve that can still be hit by their opponent, albeit with slightly more difficulty.\nMy advice is to forget about serving short for now and simply focus on getting as much backspin as possible. The main reason professional players serve short is to stop their opponent from looping the backspin serve. Chances are the person you’re playing won’t be able to loop a long backspin serve anyway, so you don’t really need to worry about it.\nHow to create super heavy backspin\nIt actually pretty easy to serve with super heavy backspin; it’s all about learning to hack underneath the ball instead of hitting or tapping it on the back. There are two essential principles to understand;\nYour bat face needs to be completely open. Start and finish the service motion with your bat horizontal to the table (you don’t need to do anything fancy). This bat angle means that you will be able to slice the ball on contact. It is this fine brushing contact that is important.\nYou need to accelerate your bat towards the ball as fast as possible. If you service action is slow you won’t get much spin. It is the racket speed that creates super heavy backspin. You can achieve this acceleration from your elbow (easier) or your elbow and wrist together (better but more difficult). Perhaps start with your wrist locked in position and once you’ve got the hang of it using your elbow you can add in a bit of wrist.\nHere’s a YouTube video of a guy showing us how it’s done.\nHe’s got a lot of thumbs down on that video because he doesn’t actually breakdown his technique for the ‘ghost serve’ and the serves aren’t that good. But if you are a beginner (and I’m assuming this guy was when he shot this video) then that serve is fine for you. He is getting plenty of backspin which is going to stop an opponent from attacking. The key is the speed of arm movement which results in a very fine contact on the bottom of the ball.\nYou can do that sort of serve with your forehand or your backhand and to all different points on the table. As long as you open up your bat face and hack under the ball you’ll be okay.\nTo generate even more spin try throwing the ball a little higher. The higher you throw it the faster it will accelerate on the way down and the more spin you will be able to impart on the ball. Try throwing it up to head height. Many beginners barely allow the ball to leave their hand. There’s nothing wrong with a high toss!\nAnd you don’t even need a table to practice it all. Just grab a bat and ball and start working on your contact. Try the serve on carpet and see if you can get the ball to come back to you when it hitting the floor. Do this over and over until you are comfortable with the arm action and ball contact.\nWinning points with it\nThe simplest way to win points with this serve is if your opponent puts the ball straight into the net. If they try to hit that serve you can be sure it’s going straight into the bottom of the net. That’s a point to you without even doing anything.\nChances are they will quickly work out that they need to push your serve, or at least get their bat underneath it. A really heavy backspin serve can still go into the net even with a push (if they aren’t very good at pushing). Lots of players struggle with their forehand push more than their backhand push, so serving into their forehand half could be a good tactic.\nIf you are playing someone that is able to push all your serves back, that’s okay too. You’ve stopped them from being able to attack your serve and you can now decide what to do with their push. If they’ve played a good push you might have to push it back. Look for an angle and try and get lots of backspin on your push. Push heavy and deep can be a good tactic. If their push was poor, and lacks backspin, you may be able to attack it.\nThe final way to win points is to chuck in a fast serve every now and again. If you opponent is expecting your super heavy backspin serve there is good chance you will now be able to catch them out with a fast serve. When you were serving fast 100% of the time the chances of this happening were slim but now that you have your super heavy backspin serve things have changed.\nImproving the serve\nEventually you’ll start playing players that are able to loop a long heavy backspin serve. You’d be surprised how difficult this is though and you’ll probably get away with serving long for longer than you’d think.\nOnce you find your super heavy backspin serves getting looped past you it’s time to start working on getting them short (bouncing twice on your opponents side of the table). This should be too difficult. All you need to do is try and get any even finer contact underneath the ball (if you hack it too much it will always go long) and aim for the bounce on your side to be slightly closer to the net.\nIf you picture the net like a mirror that should help. If your serve bounces close to the net on your side it will bounce close to the net on your opponent’s side (staying short). If your serve bounces close to the end line on your side it will bounce close to the end line on your opponent’s side (going long).\nIt might take a little bit of practice but it shouldn’t be too difficult to pick up.\nSo there we have it; the super heavy backspin serve.  This is a serve that every table tennis player should learn and one that can be particularly ruthless at the beginner level.\nFocus on heavy spin first and worry about the length later.\nMake sure you slice underneath the ball.\nAccelerate your bat as much as possible on contact.\nThink about aiming at your opponents forehand side if their forehand push is weaker (it often is).\nPractice your fine contact as much as possible."

    "title": "How to Serve Faster in Table Tennis",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJune 8, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Serve Faster in Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Serve Faster in Table Tennis\nIn a previous post I wrote about\nthe importance of developing a super heavy backspin serve\n. If you are a beginner (up against another beginner) and you can serve heavy backspin you are giving yourself a big advantage.\nBut it’s no good serving heavy backspin every time because your opponent will get used to it. You need another serve to alternate in. You need a fast serve. A really fast serve. But how do you serve fast and still keep the ball on the table? Here’s the trick…\nChances are your topspin service action is probably fine. I mean, I doubt it’s perfect but it is good enough. Once again, don’t spend hours copying the service action of the professional players. That isn’t going to help you. All you’ll end up with is an ineffective serve that kind of resembles that of a good player but with none of the dangerous effect.\nThere are just two things you need to concern yourself with when trying to serve faster, and faster, and faster.\n1. The ball’s height at contact\nThis is extremely important;\nyou need to let the ball drop much further than feels comfortable.\nWhen we serve, we throw the ball up and then as it falls we need to make contact. Most of us contact the ball too high. We rush it a little bit. I do this too. Fortunately we get away with it for most of our serves. It is only when we try and serve super fast that we realise contacting the ball too high just doesn’t work.\nIn order to serve fast you need to hit the ball pretty hard.\nBut if you hit the ball hard and make contact too high above the table you are going to shoot the ball down into the table and it is going to bounce back up, high, and probably end up going long (off the end of the table).\nTeach yourself to wait a split second longer, until the ball is lower and closer to table height, and you will be able to hit the ball more forwards instead of down. It’s subtle, and you may not notice much difference at first, but keep at it and you will get used to it.\nYou are going to feel uncomfortable. Like you are waiting so long that you might even miss the ball. You wont. But you’ll need to practice this over and over until you are able to get comfortable letting the ball drop really low before you hit it.\nAt this point you may discover that you are shooting a lot of serve, super fast, but straight into the net. You can’t seem to get the ball up in time to clear the net. That is where point number two comes into the mix…\n2. The bounce on your side of the table\nIn order to get a serve that is fast, low and manages to get up and over the net in time;\nyou need to aim for your own endline and hit the ball into that.\nIf you are serving from the corner of the table (and I recommend you do because the table is much longer corner-to-corner) then you need to get your serve to bounce as close to your own corner as possible. Let it stray too far towards the net and you are in for a disaster.\nI was taught this trick at the age of 14 at county training. My fast serve had always been slow because if I tried to get any pace on the ball it would end up going into the net. The coach licked his finger and drew an ‘x’ right in the corner of the table where I was serving and told me to aim at it. It was only then that I realised how far forward my fast serves were going. It took me a few attempts to get the bounce back towards me but after a few more goes I was able to shoot my serve straight into the corner of the table and surprise, surprise… it immediately started going fast and hard diagonally into my opponents backhand corner.\nThey were the fastest serves I had ever done and I could do them with all different types of service technique and action. The action wasn’t important, and neither was the spin, it was all about letting the ball drop and aiming at my own endline.\nGive it a go!\nIt doesn’t matter whether you have been playing for years or are a completely beginner. Practice implementing these two points into your fast serve and I guarantee you will see an immediate improvement. Combine this super fast serve with your\nsuper heavy backspin serve\nand you will have a decent set of serves that should win you plenty of points against unsuspecting opponents.\nOnce you mastered doing it diagonally it’s time to try it into the center of the table or down the line. This is a little trickier (because the table is shorter along these lines) but the same principles apply and with a bit of practice you’ll pick it up.\nThen it’s all about getting ready should they return it. After a super fast serve you need to be ready for a quick topspin return or block. Try and attack the ball if you can. After a heavy backspin serve you need to be ready for a push. If you haven’t got a steady loop your best bet is to push it back.\nI hope those tips help you continue working on your service game."

    "text": "The Expert in a Year Challenge\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge took place during 2014 and followed the progress of novice table tennis player,\nSam Priestley\n, as he attempted to go from beginner to expert in just one year and break into the top 250 table tennis players in England.\nHis progress was incredible! Despite not reaching the initial target they had set, Sam started with nothing and, in just one year, turned himself into a competitive player.\nShortly after the completion of the challenge, a video highlighting Sam’s transformation went viral on YouTube and has now amassed over 4 million views!\nGuy Plays Table Tennis Every Day for a Year\nsparked a huge amount of interest in the ‘Expert in a Year’ idea and inspired many others to try their hand at mastering a skill in a year. There’s even an active\nExpert in a Year subreddit\non Reddit now where people from all over the world are sharing their own challenges.\nTo watch all of the Expert in a Year videos on YouTube,\nclick here\n.\nExpert in a Year: The Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge\n, released in August 2015, is the complete story of the experiment, written in Sam’s words. If you are a beginner/improver that is serious about developing your table tennis, this is a must read.\nHere is the blurb…\nSam Priestley was never Mr Sporty. After failed attempts at rowing and running he had all but given up on the possibility of becoming a sportsman. That was until childhood friend, and table tennis coach, Ben Larcombe convinced him to act as the guinea pig in an experiment he had concocted – The Expert in a Year Challenge.\nStarting 1st January 2014 novice Sam was immersed in the world of competitive table tennis. He began training every day and over the course of the year notched up hundreds of hours of practice in an attempt to reach a seemingly impossible goal. There was blood, sweat, tears, injuries, frustrations and moments of elation as the pair travelled up and down the UK, and beyond, in their quest for training, mentors and competition. Sam found potential he never thought he had, got better at table tennis than most people thought possible, and discovered what it feels like when 1.5 million people watch you fail. Here is their story, including all the ridiculous training methods and unreachable goals, and the surprising lessons they learnt from playing table tennis every day for a year.\nIf you would like to buy a copy of Expert in a Year: The Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge (by Sam Priestley & Ben Larcombe) you can do so on Amazon…\nIn the UK, you can buy it for\n£3.99 (Kindle)\nand\n£10.00 (Paperback)\n.\nIn the US, you can buy it for\n$5.99 (Kindle)\nand\n$14.99 (Paperback)\n.\nYou can also download the audiobook for FREE if you join\nAudible.com\nor\nAudible.co.uk\n!\nContents\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nJanuary 2014\nFebruary 2014\nMarch 2014\nApril 2014\nMay 2014\nJune 2014\nJuly 2014\nAugust 2014\nSeptember 2014\nOctober 2014\nNovember 2014\nDecember 2014\nJanuary 2015\nConclusions\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nFor those of you who don’t know me, my name is\nBen Larcombe\nand this is my website (\nExpertTableTennis.com\n). I’m the guy who originally came up with the ‘Expert in a Year’ idea, and I was the one acting as Sam’s coach for the entire process.\nMy interest in the study of skill acquisition, rapid learning, talent and deliberate practice was sparked during my final year at university (2010-2011). I wrote my dissertation on\nthe role of deliberate practice in table tennis expertise\nand read a number of really thought-provoking books such as\nBounce\nby Matthew Syed,\nOutliers\nby Malcolm Gladwell,\nThe 4-Hour Chef\nby Tim Ferriss,\nThe First 20 Hours\nby Josh Kaufman, and not forgetting the excellent\nBreaking 2000\nby “zero-to-hero” table tennis player\nAlex Polyakov\n.\nIn short, I was inspired by these books to try out the theory in the real world. To listen to my original idea for the challenge please watch the video below…\nSo, the basic concept for my challenge was simple;\nwith sufficient practice and coaching can a novice player become an expert at table tennis in just one year?\nFortunately, my good friend Sam Priestley quickly agreed to act as the guinea-pig in my experiment. As luck would have it, Sam and his housemates had bought a table tennis table for their flat in late 2013 and were competing fiercely against each other on a daily basis.\nWe set a start date for the challenge of January 1st 2014 and decided to film a few ‘before’ videos.\nYou can see that he had played a fair amount of recreational table tennis before I started coaching him. He could keep the ball on the table and he knew most of the rules of the game. Apart from that, he was a clean slate ready to learn all the correct techniques and skills.\nJanuary 2014\nWe started Sam’s daily table tennis training on the first day of the year and began working through\nthe four basic strokes\nand the other fundamentals of the game. We spent the whole month working on the basics.\nSam’s technique improved massively but by the end of the month he was still losing comfortably to his flatmates.\nFebruary 2014\nIn February, we began to work on a few more advanced strokes; such as the topspin, loop, and open up. We were still taking things very slowly and trying to develop a solid technical foundation.\nWe visited\nSwerve TTC\nin Middlesbrough for a three-day\ntraining camp\n. This was Sam’s first experience of table tennis outside of the kitchen. He lost to a 10-year-old.\nMarch 2014\nTraining started getting much more serious in March. Sam bought\nall of the gear\nand was training hard both physically and technically. We spent much of the month working on his topspin/loop strokes and turning him into an attacking player.\nSam received an hour of private coaching from Sherwin Remata, working mainly on footwork and his loop technique.\nApril 2014\nApril was the final month of our first phase of training; How to Play. We were trying to make sure that Sam’s technique was adequate for all of the different strokes. We also introduced more matchplay into our sessions. Sam was doing his own physical training and service practice pretty much every day.\nWe managed to get back up to Swerve TTC for a couple of days and also attended Eli Baraty’s Easter\ntraining camp\n.\nMay 2014\nIn May, we began the second phase of our training; How to Win. The focus shifted more towards how to win points and we were thinking much more about tactics and less about technique. Sam was doing much better in matches against his housemates.\nSam went to Malta for a few days for work but was able to train at the\nHiTT Academy\n, receiving private coaching from head coach Mario Genovese.\nJune 2014\nJune saw us doing a lot of training in the kitchen as we approached the halfway point of the challenge. We also began going regularly to ISH TTC on Sunday nights to give Sam some match practice. As the challenge progressed, this match practice against local players would become more and more important.\nWe filmed an\n‘Ask Me Anything’ video\ntowards the end of the month and allowed readers to send in questions for the two of us to answer.\nJuly 2014\nJuly saw us take our first trip abroad as we headed to Denmark for the famous\nB75 Summer Camp\n. It was a brilliant camp and we both trained hard for nine days and learned loads from all of the expert coaches.\nThe focus of our training really began to shift to primarily serve and receive, to give Sam the best chance of winning matches in a few months time. We were both pretty happy with his general technique by this point so decided not to spend too much time trying to improve it further.\nAugust 2014\nAugust was a strange month because I was away for much of it on various holidays. Sam was still training hard though. He had a bit of a break after Denmark and then had quite a few one-to-one sessions with other coaches in London, before attending another\ntraining camp\n(this time in Eger, Hungary).\nWe reached the end of our second phase of training and began approaching the final four months. The focus switched almost entirely to matchplay. It was vital that Sam was getting plenty of experience against a range of local players with different techniques and styles.\nSeptember 2014\nSam took a week off from training at the start of September for a family holiday. I think it was really needed and helped him to regain his drive and motivation when he returned.\nWe spent the rest of the month doing loads of training, particularly focusing on match situations, and going to local clubs in the evenings for some extra match practice. We went along to watch the Medway Grand Prix to give Sam an idea of what he’d be up against once he started competing.\nOctober 2014\nOctober saw us continue going to lots of local clubs (ISH, Highbury, and Finsbury TTC) to give Sam more experience against different types of players. It was kind of like the calm before the storm because we knew that November meant the start of tournaments, which would mean a very busy time and lots of weekends away.\nIn our one-to-one sessions we were working lots on “plays” such as; short serve, pushing, and forehand open up. We also spent a lot of time working on Sam’s return of serve, both learning how to read the spin and also practising attacking long serves.\nNovember 2014\nSam’s first official\nTable Tennis England\nranking tournament was the Bristol Grand Prix on Saturday 15th November. The week before he managed to go along to a local tournament organised by Rory Scott in Horsham to get a feel for competing. Then on Saturday 22nd November we went to Cippenham for their 1-Star tournament.\nIt was a tough start for Sam at all three. He came up against a lot of experienced local league players, and a handful of senior county-level players and top juniors. It was always going to be difficult for him to put everything he had learnt from practice into his matches when facing such tricky opponents. However, it was encouraging for him to win a match in his Band 6 group at Bristol and also to win a match in the first round of the consolation event at Cippenham.\nDecember 2014\nDecember was another busy month for competitions with Sam playing in the Nottingham Grand Prix, a local Central London league tournament organised by Highbury TTC, the Cardiff Grand Prix, and then just after Christmas, a BATTS Super Series.\nThe highlight of the month was definitely Sam reaching the semi-final of his event in the Central London tournament. He played quite well on the day and was feeling rather uncomfortable being one of the favourites to win (not a position he often found himself in). It was tough going in the other tournaments with Sam coming up against a number of very strong players and doing well simply to pick up points against them.\nJanuary 2015\nWe played for a week and a half into 2015 because it coincided nicely with a couple of tournaments. Sam played in the Sussex Grand Prix and put out some great performances against a number of very good players, including Team GB Paralympian\nDavid Wetherill\n! He was very happy to get a 3-1 win over Steve Hirst (who had been on the B75 Summer Camp with us in July).\nThe Expert in a Year challenge officially ended on Sunday 11th January (a year and 11 days after it began) once we had finished playing in the Cippenham Teams 2-Star competition. It was a great way to finish as we (Ben & Sam) were able to play together as a team and had a lot of fun. We came 16th out of 24 teams and, despite not winning any matches, Sam put out some really great performances against Ed Slot, Steve Smith and Neil Wright.\nConclusions\nOnce the dust had settled, I wrote a fairly comprehensive blog post (4,000 words) reviewing the challenge, talking about how I came up with the idea, the theory behind it, some inspiration from other challenges and authors, and why I think Sam was unable to achieve a top 250 ranking.\nIs It Possible to Master Table Tennis in 12 Months?\nSam also wrote an article, on his own blog, about his experience of the challenge.\nSpectacularly Failing to Become an Expert in a Year\nThen we filmed a Q&A session and asked for questions about the challenge. We answered ten of the most popular questions.\nFinally, I released a video to end the Expert in a Year challenge. It was filmed on the final day of the project and shows Sam’s level after a year of table tennis. It also displays the number of hours he spent practicing and a few other stats about what we got up to over the year and people we would like to thank.\nIt was a brilliant year. An awful lot of hard work (for both of us) but lots of fun too. Most of all, it was a learning experience. It taught us so much about not only table tennis but also learning and mastery in general. The main lesson we took away was that…\nMastery is tough, but mastery is possible.\nThe only thing left to say now is, thank you for following the Expert in a Year challenge. It was great to have so many people leaving comments, sending us emails and messages, and saying “hello” at tournaments. I hope you enjoyed the journey as much as we did!"

I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, especially as I’ve been coaching players that didn’t start their table tennis with me.\nI’m always barking on about the importance of developing solid technique at the early stages of your table tennis but what happens if you’ve been playing for a while without much coaching? Perhaps you’ve joined a local league, or played regularly with friends, and have started to get quite good. You’re now able to win some matches and hold your own against some decent looking players.\nIf this sounds like you and you would like to take your table tennis a bit more seriously, and really begin improving your game, then I’m afraid the way forward may be taking a few steps back.\nLet me explain.\nChances are if this is ringing true for you, you probably fit into one of these two groups;\nUnorthodox players:\nYour technique is pretty much completely unorthodox and self-taught. You may have had a tiny amount of coaching but you’ve pretty much just played shots as you like. You’ve spent quite a lot of time playing and have got quite good at playing ‘your way’ but you realise that your technique has little in common to the players you see on TV or in the premier division of your local league.\nOrthodox players:\nTo the average player your technique looks about right. You have received some coaching (perhaps not enough or too long ago to remember) and you’re doing your best to play correctly. You’ve been playing for long enough that people would think it a bit odd (or even rude) to mention to you that your technique is not quite right. You might even be a very good and respected player.\nIn my coaching, I’ve encountered players in both of these groups and everywhere in between and I have tried, with varying degrees of success, to encourage them to spend some time going back over the basics in order to see greater improvements, to their game, in the future. To be fair to the players, most have got fully on board with what I’m trying to do.\nWhat do I mean by ‘back to basics’?\nWhen I talk about getting ‘back to basics’ with your table tennis I’m really talking about;\nCorrecting your grip and stance (here is a picture of bad grip, haha).\nTweaking, or in some cases completely reworking, the four basic strokes.\nLearning how to move, footwork, weight transfer etc.\nIn my mind, these are the three areas that should be covered extensively when you are learning the basics as a beginner and therefore should be correct in all intermediate and advanced players. Obviously everybody will have slight, tiny differences in the way they hold the bat, stand, play their strokes and move, but there is still a generally accepted ‘best practice’ that should be modeled near enough.\nWhy is it so important to go ‘back to basics’?\nThis is a question that I’m asked every now and again and I have a number of different answers depending on the player;\nA fault in your technique is holding you back from developing further.\nFor example, an ineffective grip is giving you a weak backhand or forcing you to change between shots which is slowing you down. Or, your near vertical backhand drive technique is stopping you from being able to develop a backhand topspin and making you punch instead.\nA fault in your technique is affecting your current game.\nFor example, your flat-footed stance is making you very slow moving around the table and lowering your current standard of play. Or, your lack of weight transfer is making your otherwise great forehand topspin lacking in power and easy to return.\nA fault in your technique could cause you injuries in the future.\nFor example, the way you ‘throw’ your shoulder during your forehand may be putting excessive load on the joint and could lead to a repetitive strain injury. Or, your stance could lead to back problems when you play big shots.\nThe answer is always slightly different and targeted to the particular needs of the player but you get the idea.\nYou may be thinking, “Can’t these issues just be dealt with right here, right now, instead of going back to the drives and pushes etc.”, but I believe it’s always better to get it right at the simple level first. When my players do eventually move on to learning to topspin or loop the ball it’s unbelievable how quickly some of them are able to pick it up because they have spent the hours, before, perfecting their forehand drive.\nI often ask them, “Have you done this before, somewhere else?”, to which they reply, “No”. This is why I always think it’s best to go back to basics. If the problem is too much side-wards wrist on your backhand topspin (for example), go back to the backhand drive and correct it there. Once you can do that, then try again with the topspin. You’ll find it much easier to correct in your slower and more consistent backhand drive and then much easier to transfer to your backhand topspin.\nHow to go ‘back to basics’?\nIf you’ve got to this point I’m assuming you agree with me to some degree but now we come to the question, “How do I go back to basics?”\nIf you have a good coach\nthen this one is easy. They probably already know the parts of your game/technique that need tweaking but might not have wanted to make a big deal out of it or thought you weren’t interested. Simply ask them and see what they say.\nWhen I went to Denmark for a training camp a couple of summers ago I was amazed by how much time the coaches spent ripping apart what I assumed was my pretty spot-on technique. However, after a few sessions I realised what they were talking about (there was a bit of a language barrier too!) and was able to see how much more effective their recommendations were. If you have a good coach, you don’t have too much to worry about.\nIf you don’t have a coach\nthen you will need to do a lot more work yourself. Here are some things to think about;\nAre you able to video yourself? –\nIt can be much easier spotting faults in your own technique if you are able to watch yourself and rewind and watch again. Film yourself playing a range of shots, and then a game, and you may be surprised at what you see.\nAsk other players and compare yourself to them –\nThey might say the wrong things or they might be doing the wrong things but by comparing yourself to them and using a bit of common sense you should be able to play spot-the-difference and at least try out a few things.\nRead articles and watch training videos –\nThere are a number of good table tennis blogs out there and countless free technique videos on YouTube. Spend time learning the basic techniques and strokes back-to-front. You can teach yourself and become a bit of a coach just by reading and watching. Once you understand the shots, think about how the key points relate to your own technique.\nConclusion\nThat’s quite a long post and I only intended to write a short one. I guess I got a bit carried away talking about a subject I’m passionate about; technique.\nMy final thoughts; it can seem annoying and certainly not the most fun part of your table tennis training but if you’re serious about improving your level then I can’t stress enough how important I believe it is to go back to basics and make sure you’re doing everything in the most efficient way.\nIf you’ve got a coach then congratulations, if not I’d be happy to help. If you have any questions then I’ve got a new page called “\nAsk Me a Question\n” which you can find in the top navigation under “ASK”. I’d love to hear from you and help you out. Alternatively, record yourself playing and email it to me! I’d be happy to watch it and give you some pointers, for free (of course).\nThank you very much for reading and good luck in the training hall!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nOctober 8, 2012\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n‘Service Detention’ and How to Improve Your Table Tennis Serve\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n'Service Detention' and How to Improve Your Table Tennis Serve\nSo you want to improve your table tennis serve… join the club. My service is probably one of the weakest areas of my game, which is stupid because it’s so important!\nWhen you are serving in table tennis you have complete control of the ball. You can decide how the rally starts. Do you want to do a short serve with backspin and force someone to open up? Do you want to try and fast serve into your opponents weaker side and look to catch them out and finish off the point with a third ball winner? You have complete control over the power, spin and positioning of the ball and you should really be making the most of that advantage.\nFor every other shot in a table tennis game, to a varying degree, you will be reacting to your opponents decisions but right here, as you stand with the ball in your palm, it’s all you!\nHow to Improve Your Table Tennis Serve\nThis post isn’t going to be going into the technical details of how to get more spin on your serves or how to disguise them to greater effect, I’ll leave that for another post. In this post I’ll be looking more generally at some of the things you can do to improve the quality of your serves in table tennis. Here are some of my top tips…\nPractice, practice practice:\nAs with learning any skill, practice is the key. I have spent over ten years playing table tennis but only occasionally have I spent any significant amount of time working specifically on improving my service game. Hence, my serves are pretty rubbish.\nLearn from others:\nWhether you’re an international player or a complete beginner, I’m sure you know somebody that has better serves than you or is better at a particular serve. Watch their action. You can learn a lot from just observing others performing a skill (this is something I’ve recently discovered and am keen to write a post about). Ask them for tips. Asking questions is a great way to learn and iron out any individual problems you may be having. Also make sure you find a way to use feedback in your service practice.\nDouble up:\nResearch has shown that we actually learn better (and by that I mean retain what we’ve learnt more successfully) if we alternate between two skills. If you would like to improve your reverse serve, for example, then mix it up with a serve you are more comfortable with, such as the sidespin pendulum. Forcing your brain to switch between the two will stop it from getting into a habit of movement and performing the serve on autopilot. This will help you retain more of what you’ve practiced later on.\nUse targets:\nIf it’s accuracy you are going for, using targets is a good way of providing yourself with instant feedback. You could use a bat case, a bat, or a small square of paper. Try to hit your chosen target a certain number of times out of twenty serves. Then have another go and try to beat it. If you’re getting really accurate you can use a slightly squashed table tennis ball as a target. Believe me it’s a good feeling when your serve clips that ball and sends it skidding along the table!\nSave time:\nFor most of us, time is short. Save time by investing in a box of practice balls. You can get a hundred or so for about £20-£30 and they’ll last ages. This way you can keep serving, over and over, getting the most out of the time that you have. To save your back, you might want to invest in a collection net as well, if your venue doesn’t already have one.\nHave an aim:\nI sometimes put kids on service practice in the group sessions I coach and I always try to bang home the point that they must have an aim for the five minutes or so they have on service. Too often I glance over and they’re serving a hundred balls a minute, with about four balls in their free hand and not really learning anything. Yes we want to get through as many serves as possible but it’s important to take your time, create ‘match-like’ conditions and focus on improve one or two aspects per session.\nFind a receiver:\nEvery now and again it can be good to do your service practice against another player. You wont always be able to find someone but just having them there will probably increase your concentration and in turn, the quality of your serves. It’s good to get an idea of which serves opponents find difficult and which ones you may need to improve further. They’ll probably find it useful too. We all need to practice our receive as well as our service!\nBe deceptive:\nIt can be easy to focus too much on the quality of the serve (power, spin and placement) and forget about trying to make it hard to ‘read’. Individual service practice is the time to try out different ways to confuse your opponents with wrist flicks and arm movements that suggest different spins. Remember an excellent serve that is really easy to read is often not as good as a lower quality serve that can be disguised and produced with variations of spin and placement.\nSo those are my top tips. I was going to think of ten but I decided to stop at eight. I’ve probably missed out something really important, so if you spot it, please leave a comment and let me know.\nWhat is ‘Service Detention’?\nIf you read the title of this post you’re probably thinking, “What on earth is ‘Service Detention’? Ben’s written a whole post and hasn’t mentioned it once!” Well if you’ve never heard of service detention before you’re not alone… because I only came up with it a couple of days ago.\nI coach table tennis at a school in London. Occasionally a child will be messing about or will have forgot a part of their kit and they will be given a PE detention. They are given a detention because their behaviour was not up to scratch and it is hoped that the detention will do something to improve this. The detention usually takes the form of 15 minutes at the end of the school day.\nSo what is ‘service detention’? Well my serves are not up to scratch, so I have decided to give myself ‘service detention’. I coach at the school everyday, from Monday to Friday, so for 15 minutes, after I have finished my coaching session, I am going to stay and practice my serves. I thought the name ‘service detention’ was kind of apt seeing as I would be staying late, at school, for 15 minutes, doing what is really quite a repetitive task!\nI started today (Monday 8th October 2012) and spent 15 minutes working on my reverse serve (which is currently appalling!), interspersed with some sidespin ones and a few fast topspin serves, of course. What was even more funny was that there was a year 9 boy on an actual PE detention at the time, so he got the job of walking around with the net and picking up all of my stray table tennis balls. I guess that’s a further extension to my fifth point from earlier, ‘Save time’!\nI will be on ‘service detention’ every single day, after I have finished coaching, until July 2013, the end of the school year. By then I will have spent more than 50 hours working on my table tennis serves and I hope to have made some dramatic improvements. If you ever happen to bump into me, please ask me how my ‘service detentions’ are going. That will stop me from giving up after a couple of weeks.\nWell that’s about all. This was supposed to be a short one but it seems I’ve written a fair bit. Nevermind. I hope you’ve found something in that which you will be able to adapt and apply to your own practice.\nThank you so much for reading.

    "title": "Are You Doing What You Think You’re Doing?",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nOctober 31, 2014\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nAre You Doing What You Think You’re Doing?\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nAre You Doing What You Think You're Doing?\nIn a nutshell, I’m using today’s post as another opportunity to convince you of the power of filming yourself playing table tennis. But I’ll also go a bit more into the reason why you need to start filming and analysing your own game.\nI’m always shocked when I go to a tournament and there are only a handful of players filming their matches. We train regularly throughout the week, travel up and down the country on the weekends to play competitively but don’t actually record any of our performances. Why are so few people filming?\nI think the main reason is that we have this assumption that we already know what we are doing wrong, we know what we need to improve. I’ll often hear players say after a game, and I’m often guilty of this myself, “Yeah, I know what I need to do. I’ll sort it out in my next game. I just couldn’t get in going in this game. My shots weren’t working today.” We like to think that we have a pretty good understand of what is going on in the game and where the problems are. We did the right things it just didn’t work out in this match. You can’t win them all after all!\nI think we give ourselves too much credit. Actually, scratch that. I know we give ourselves too much credit.\nThe key question is…\nAre you doing what you think you’re doing?\nIt’s easy just to answer, “yes”, and assume that there is no difference between how you think you are playing and how you are actually playing, but from my experience that is rarely the case. More often that not we think we are doing things much better in our heads than in reality. Our body, and specifically our mind, is lying to us. Or it’s distorting the truth at least.\nWhen we play a forehand loop in a match, using our standard technique, it feels perfect and we see in our heads a perfect shot. When we serve our favourite serve we can imagine how it looks to our opponent, the crisp contact, the deception that makes it difficult to read, the way we let it drop low so that we contact it at close to table height. This is what we see and feel as we perform these actions but is it what our opponent sees? Is it realistic to what we are actually doing or is our brain sugar-coating it for us?\n“Everybody look at An Shu”\nWhen I was in Denmark this summer Lars, the organiser of the camp, invited me into one of the coaches evening meetings. Once all the coaches were sitting down and the seminar had started Lars stopped and said, “Everybody look at An Shu” (An Shu was one of the Chinese coaches on the camp and also a player in the top Swedish table tennis league). We all looked over at An Shu for a few seconds to see if he was going to do anything. Then Lars said, “Why is this impossible?”\n“Why is this impossible?”\nSome of the coaches in the room didn’t speak much English so translator coaches were translating the question into Chinese and French whilst everyone else looked a little confused. We were all looking at An Shu. It’s not impossible because we are all doing it right now. Is this some kind of trick question?\nThen Lars said, “because An Shu cannot look at An Shu”.\nHe continued the meeting and spoke all about the role of the coach and how they much both understand their players and help their players to understand themselves.\nI took a huge amount of notes in the meeting, and Lars had so much great information to share, however this is the idea that has stuck with me more than anything from that session.\n“Because An Shu cannot look at An Shu!”\nEverybody else in the room can see An Shu. We can see exactly where he is in relation to the room (Is he in the centre of the room? Who is next to him? Behind him?). We can see how he is sitting (Is his posture good? Does he look relaxed in his seat?). We can see his facial expressions (What emotions is his face displaying? Does he look happy? Confident? Tired? Bored?).\nAn Shu may think there is nobody behind him, but I saw a coach come in late a sit behind him on the kitchen counter. An Shu may think he is sitting up straight in his chair, but actually he looks a little stiff and uncomfortable, especially now that he has become the centre of the meeting. An Shu may think he looks confident and composed, but in fact he looks a little anxious.\nWe did quite a lot of filming our training sessions, especially multiball training, in Denmark. We would do a multiball drill, film it, watch it back, discuss it with a coach and then have another go. I was shocked at the disparity between what I thought I looked like when I played at what I actually looked like.\nWas I doing what I thought I was doing? No!\nI thought I was crouched down really low throughout the drill, but after the first few shots my back straightened and I played from then on in quite an upright position.\nI thought my wrist was in quite a neutral position, but actually it was bent open (favouring a forehand fade/down the line shot) from the word go. I still struggle with this.\nI thought I always did a good job at transferring my weight from my right foot to my left foot on all my forehand topspins, but it turns out on any wide balls I pivot on my right foot and end up getting very little power.\nThis is why we need to start filming, practice and matches. If you aren’t getting accurate feedback on your faults then you won’t be aware that you need to make any changes. I think we all have a tendency to picture ourselves looking much better than we actually do. It appears to be common among everyone.\nWhen I watch back a match or training session with a player for the first time they are usually embarrassed by how bad they think they look when they play. I don’t understand it. I’ve watched them play many times and to me they don’t look like they are playing particularly bad in this video. The thing is that what they thought they were doing isn’t what they are actually doing, and watching themselves on video for the first time has made this painfully obvious.\nThey always thought that they rotated their hips on their forehand shots but here they can see the truth, right in front of their eyes, they don’t really. Their hips barely move. They thought they had loads of wrist in their backhand shots to generate a snappy spinny shot, but the video clearly shows that their backhand shot has a lot of shoulder and elbow in it and very little wrist. No wonder they always struggle to play a quick backhand when they are rushed for time.\nSam knows about this all too well\nWe have used video analysis and feedback heavily in the\nExpert in a Year\nchallenge. Just this week we had a tripod and camera set up under the table to film Sam’s footwork on a regular drill. To me, as the coach who is watching Sam move, it looked like Sam was barely moving as he moved across to play a forehand topspin from his wide forehand. To Sam, the one actually doing the moving, it felt like he was doing a huge movement and when I kept telling him he needed to move his feet further and faster he thought I was being ridiculous. Then we watched it back on the camera…\n“Oh yeah, my feet are barely moving” says Sam.\nThis is just the way it is. Our mind plays tricks on us. We think we are doing one thing when in fact we are doing something else entirely. This is why you need to be filming your practice and matches. This is why it’s so important that you review that video and adjust your training accordingly.\nFootball has been onto this for years. The professional clubs employ whole teams of people to video and analyse the matches for them. The manager used to just watch the game from the sidelines and then tell the players what they were doing wrong. But then some people looked into it and realised that even the manager couldn’t remember most of what had actually happened in the game and was seeing it all through his own lense.\nThe video doesn’t lie.\nAre you doing what you think you’re doing? Probably not. But start filming yourself regularly and you are bound to notice a whole array of things you can begin to work on and improve to make your actually game look more like you think it does."

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nFebruary 8, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTransferring Technique from Practice to Competition\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTransferring Technique from Practice to Competition\nIf you’re the parent of a young and ambitious table tennis player then this ‘Ask Me a Question’ post will definitely be of interest to you. I won’t waffle on, here’s the question;\nChris, from Ireland, asked;\n“Hi Ben,\nMy son is nine years old and absolutely loves the sport. He has a great coach, however, he’s having trouble transferring what he has learnt in training to competition. When he hits the ball correctly he does well but during competitive matches he doesn’t always apply what he’s been taught consistently.\nDo you have any advice for a struggling parent? I try not to pressurise him and emphasise his enjoyment but it would be great to see his confidence boosted by a good day.\nThanks for any help in advance,\nChris”\nResponse\nBeing the parent of a young table tennis player can be tricky. It’s hard to know how involved to get in your child’s development. You don’t want to be a “pushy parent” but at the same time you don’t want to be completely “hands-off” and appear uninterested or let their potential slip away.\nHere are my thoughts;\n1. Less emphasis on competitions and winning at a young age\nI usually encourage parents not too take young players to too many tournaments. I think in the UK, and particularly in table tennis, we start kids off too early when it comes to competitions and it would be much better to concentrate on learning to play first and developing a solid technique before being thrown into matches.\nThere are coaches and clubs around the world (Spartak Tennis Club for one) that don’t allow their players to enter tournaments for 2/3 years after starting to practice to ensure that they concentrate on learning how to play first before worrying about learning how to win. Personally, I am beginning to move towards this school of thought and while I think it might not be a good idea to put down such strict rules, about when someone can and cannot play competitively, I think the general principle is a good one.\n2. Encourage and reward continual development and fun\nIt can be very hard for a child to understand the difference between playing to improve and playing to win. Children are brought up in a world that highlights the importance of winning (short-term) but for a young, developing player I don’t think this is anywhere near as important as understanding the process of continual development over time (long-term).\nEmphasis should be placed on the skills of listening, watching, practicing, concentrating and experimenting. If you can create this kind of mindset in a young and ambitious player I believe they will develop much faster, reach higher levels of ability in the future, be far less likely to experience unhappiness or feelings or inadequacy from table tennis, or decide to drop out from the sport altogether a couple of years down the line.\n3. When competing, decision making is key\nWhen the time is right to begin competing the emphasis should be completely on a players decision making, when it comes to shots and the way he plays the game (being positive and fearless etc.), rather than whether he wins or loses.\nAs a player you are not in control of whether you win or lose and as a young player it really doesn’t matter either. What you can control is how you play and the decisions that you make. That way even if your child loses the game they can come away happy if they played correctly and if they lost playing correctly it should be easy to workout which shots/parts of their game needs more work in order to be more accurate or consistent.\nIf you have a question that you would like me the answer head over to the ‘\nAsk Me a Question’\npage. I’ve linked to it in the main navigation of the site under ‘ASK’. Thanks for reading."

    "title": "Rhythm and Timing – Underrated Table Tennis Skills",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nSeptember 9, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nRhythm and Timing – Underrated Table Tennis Skills\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nRhythm and Timing - Underrated Table Tennis Skills\nRhythm and timing might sound like something out of a dance class but, in fact, they are hugely underrated table tennis skills. The ball bouncing on the table and hitting the players’ bats creates a beat and a pattern. If you can get your mind and your body in tune with that beat you will immediately start playing much better table tennis.\nFor the next few weeks, I am going to be writing a mini-series of blog posts examining a handful of these “underrated table tennis skills”. I hope that they help you to broaden your knowledge and understanding of the game and, in turn, improve your level.\nIs rhythm innate?\nDo you have good rhythm? I like to think I do. I did a Google search and managed to find an online rhythm test. I have no idea how good it actually is for testing your rhythm, but I tried it out anyway. If you would like to have a go the link is below. It only took about 5 minutes to complete.\nhttp://tonometric.com/rhythmdeaf/\nI used only one replay (on the first sound because I wasn’t really sure what was going on) and then did the rest of the test on just one listen per sound. It was pretty tough and on a few occasions I just had to guess, but I finished with a score of 80%, which is apparently “outstanding performance”. It would be interesting to see what results other people get (if you have a go please leave a comment at the bottom of this article with your score).\nIt does seem that some people just naturally have better rhythm than others. If that’s you; great! But what if you know that rhythm isn’t one of your strong points? Can you improve your rhythm?\nHere’s an interesting thought from music blogger\nLaurie Riley\n…\n“Usually when someone says they’re rhythmically challenged, it really means they’re\nbeat\n-challenged  –  they cannot follow the pulse of the music. But since beat, rhythm and tempo are interconnected, trouble with one can sometimes lead to trouble with the others. Since “sense of rhythm” is the phrase that is most commonly used even though it really usually means “sense of beat”, for this article I’ll use the common phrase.”\nSo, from the sounds of it, it’s all about your ability to stay “on beat”. There are loads of suggestions for how to improve your “sense of rhythm” in a musical sense, and Laurie recommends trying to clap along to different songs. I’m sure this might help in a general sense, but I reckon that something more table tennis specific would be a better use of time. That got me thinking…\nThe Ping Pong Song\nI remembered seeing the following video on Facebook a couple of years ago. It is of a concert pianist called Joja Wendt playing a song he called “The Ping Pong Song”. For the song, he gets a couple of table tennis players to hit the ball to each other on top of the grand piano. Their rhythm and timing are so perfect that he is able to use the rally as a metronome (fortunately they don’t make any mistakes either, that would have been embarrassing).\nIf you watch the way the players move and bob to the beat it is almost as if they are dancing. Actually, I wonder if there is a link between how good someone is at dancing and how good they are at table tennis?\nAnyway, the point to take away from that is that there is a clear rhythm or beat to table tennis and you need to be able to get in sync with it. I remember watching a video of Darius Knight talking about “the beat” of table tennis too, but I can’t find it now.\nMetronome Shadow Play\nI wish I could claim that this was my own great idea but, in fact, I’ve stolen it from Steve Brunskill, head coach at\nSwerve TTC\nin Middlesbrough.\nI went up to Swerve a few times during 2014 with Sam as part of\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nand Steve would always have some great new coaching ideas for me to check out. One of them was playing a metronome on a loud speaker in the hall and then getting all the players to do shadow play drills in time with the metronome. Here’s an example of what I mean.\nI remember looking over at Sam, at Swerve, and seeing that he was struggling and was often not playing in time with the beat. Naturally, Sam wasn’t great at rhythm and timing (he struggled with skipping too which I reckon is closely linked) but as the year progressed, and he did more rhythmic drills, he made huge strides forwards.\nI believe that shadow play is brilliant and I would encourage everyone to give it a go. Adding a metronome to your shadow play is even better as the beat of the metronome becomes the ball. This will help you with your rhythm and will also keep your effort level stable because you won’t be able to slow down towards the end of a drill.\nI really like the metronome at\nwww.metronomeonline.com\nbecause you can use it in your phone’s web browser (I hate having loads of random apps) and it is super easy to use.\nI had it set at 72 bpm (beats per minute) in the video above. I wouldn’t recommend going any slower than 60 bpm otherwise I think it become unrealistically slow and you will have too long of a pause in between strokes. Have a play around with different tempos though and see what works for you.\nIntroducing Andy Couchman\nA couple of months ago Andy Couchman contacted me regarding his own table tennis challenge. He wants to break into the top 600 ranked players in England after three years of training. I spoke about Andy Couchman\nwith Sam during Episode 13 of The Expert Table Tennis Podcast\nand we both agreed that top 600 in 3 years is a very good and achievable target (unlike our Expert in a Year target of top 250 in one year).\nAndy is also keeping a blog of his progress and uploading videos to YouTube. If you would like to check that out you can do so here…\nhttp://andycouchmantabletennis.wordpress.com\nI have started working with Andy and\ngave him a coaching session a couple of weeks ago\n. One of the things I picked up on was timing errors in his shots. It was this that got me thinking about rhythm and timing in the first place.\nI asked Andy to have a go doing shadow play at home but to a metronome. He filmed it and uploaded it to YouTube. Have a watch…\nWhat you’ll see is that his shot isn’t 100% in time with the beat. Sometimes it is, but then at other times he will get ahead of it or fall behind. I wasn’t surprised to see this at all. Andy is aware that he will need to spend a bit of time working on this until he is comfortable not just with the basic technique, but also with the timing and rhythm of the strokes.\nEven more interesting was Andy’s score in the\nonline rhythm test\nI mentioned earlier. He finished with 48% which put him in the “possible rhythm perception or memory deficit” category. The question is – can this be improved? If Andy is to make it into the top 600 players in England I reckon it will have to be!\nConclusion\nThe more I coach table tennis the more I am convinced that much of what we call “talent” can actually be broken down into fundamental skills – one of which is a good “natural” sense of rhythm. The players in the training group with good rhythm pick up the strokes and the timing of their shots much faster than those without.\nTherefore, if you want to improve your table tennis you need to work on improving these seemingly unrelated and underrated fundamental skills too.\nResearch has shown that it is better to have a high IQ than a low IQ. People with a higher IQ are more likely to be successful, but only up to a point.\nMalcolm Gladwell marks this at 120 in his book outliers.\nThe thinking is, once you get past that point it really doesn’t matter if your IQ is 130 or 150. It is down to a host of other factors to determine who will be the most successful. What is important is that you are scoring at least 120.\nI would guess that your rhythm (or beat keeping) is similar. Of course, you would like it to be as good as possible but at some point you reach a threshold where further gains aren’t going to have any effect on your table tennis.\nWhere is that threshold? I’m not sure. But I don’t think you need to be scoring 100% on the impossibly hard\nonline rhythm test\n. Instead, as long as you can do a range of different shadow play drills, to a metronome, and stay “on beat”, I reckon your rhythm is fine and nothing to worry about.\nBut… if you realise that you struggle to play your strokes in time with the metronome and find yourself getting too fast or too slow (a bit like Andy), then I think it would be a good idea to continue working on your rhythm. Practice your metronome table tennis training as much as possible until you feel yourself and the beat become one."

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nAugust 16, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nAre Table Tennis Drills a Waste of Time?\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nAre Table Tennis Drills a Waste of Time?\n“Hang on a second! Did he just say what I thought he said?”\n“A coach, questioning the effectiveness of drills, surely there’s been a mistake!”\nDon’t worry, I haven’t gone mad. It’s worth pointing out as well that I’ve spent the last 14 years doing table tennis drills (as a player), and the last two teaching them to my students.\nHowever, it’s always a good idea to look at things with “fresh eyes” every once in a while and not just accept the norm as the ideal.\nYou may be thinking, “What’s brought all this on?” and I guess the answer is time. Time and a lot of reading (and a bit of thinking).\nI’m assuming by now that most of you know that I’ve been pretty busy this summer; getting married, moving flat and going on honeymoon. If you were wondering why the blog has been so quiet lately, there’s your answer. [If you’d like to see a photo of my new wife and me at our wedding I’ve added one at the end of the post.]\nBut back to the topic at hand; the effectiveness of\ntable tennis drills\n. Why am I now questioning them?\nWell, I spent a fair amount of time over the summer reading various books about learning. I guess you could say it kind of became a bit of an obsession! I read books about mastery and how to become a master at anything. I read books about how to learn skills more rapidly. I read books about the importance of being creative in your chosen discipline and experimenting with it. I then started following and reading some blogs and even dug into some of the academic literature on learning and acquiring skills.\nAfter gaining a number of opinions and ideas on the process of becoming an expert I began thinking about how this would all apply to table tennis, and in particular our table tennis practice. After all, I think the majority of us would agree that most of the work that’s done to help us master table tennis takes place in the training hall. I thought about what makes up a table tennis training session and it occurred to me that the answer for most people would be drills. If you are a table tennis player that is serious about improving and developing your game then you will likely spend a large chunk (probably 50%+) of your practice time going through various drills and therefore these drills are extremely important!\nThere are many different types of drills…\nMovement drills\nIrregular drills\nService and receive drills\nFootwork drills\nDrills for particular strokes\nOff-the-table drills\nMultiball drills\nRobot drills\n…so it can be hard to clump all “drills” together in the same category. Please just bear with me.\nI have to admit at this point that I fear this will be quiet a long one (so if you’re not feeling in the mood for that right this moment then perhaps now would be a good time to bookmark this post and come back to it another time). I’d also like to let it be known that I haven’t reached a firm conclusion on how I feel about “drills” in general but during the course of this post I’ll layout my opinions on both sides, provide some recommendations and then allow you to make up your own mind.\nDoes that sound like fun? If so, then off we go…\nWhy do we do drills?\nI guess there are many reasons we perform drills in our table tennis practice and drills have a number of benefits. For starters, they are extremely versatile. There are drills to work on your movement, your accuracy, your speed, your power, your consistency, your technique, your timing, and so on. In this sense most aspects of table tennis can be practiced in some form under the umbrella term of “drills”.\nDrills are also a great way of ensuring uniformity and quality within a group of players. If you set a team of players the same drills to do, in the same order, in the same sessions, covering the same topics, year-after-year, you will likely be able to produce well-rounded players of a similar ability with all of the techniques you deem important. This is very important if you club has different sessions based on age or ability and you want your players to steadily progress through the levels of sessions.\nOn a similar line is the fact that, as a coach, drills simplify the coaching process. Coaching players individually can be very difficult (sometimes impossible) if you have a large group of players, Drills are a great way of getting everybody involved and on task. However, this concerns me a little. I know from personal experience that setting lots of group drills in a training session makes coaching very easy. Therefore, “drills” will also appear favourable to coaches, especially less experienced coaches (or coaches that have lost their true passion for coaching). “Drills” are safe. Setting a few regular movement drills and having a wander around the training hall is unlikely to win you ‘Coach of the Year’ but it’s also unlikely to raise any eyebrows either.\nAs a player or a coach, if you don’t really know what you’re doing, or you can’t really be bothered, drills are definitely the way to go! We’ve all heard the phrase K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid) but perhaps we’ve gone too far.\nMy point is this… Perhaps the\nreal\nreason why we do so many drills in practice is that it’s best for the coaches, as opposed to being best for the players. Even if you have a good coach (or you are a good coach) it’s worth remembering this.\nAre all drills pointless then?\nNo, I don’t think they are.\nHowever, I think that too often drills are used as the norm or standard way of practicing. They are set, perhaps, with little thought into their purpose or objective and take up the bulk of a session.\nInstead, I think that drills should be used in (and for) specific circumstances. At certain stages of development, certain types of drills are useful. Also, in certain situations or environments other types of drills may be beneficial.\nMy thinking is that we need to slightly alter our mindset so that when we are thinking about how to develop players we don’t automatically go straight to drills. Perhaps the fact that drills are so versatile has meant that we’ve thought we\nmust\nuse them for everything, when in fact all it meant was that we\ncan\nuse them for everything.\nWhen are drills a good idea?\nI’ve been thinking about which drills should be used during the different stages of development and why. I’m sure the following list wont include everything but here are some applications I thought of. For each drill I will mention the type of drill, the objective of the drill and the demographic of players it is for.\n1. Regular movement drills to improve technique, footwork and consistency in beginner/improvers.\nI recommend some regular movement drills (such as “\nbackhand, middle, backhand, wide\n“) in my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\nseries. I also teach these drills to my own players. I think these types of drills, where you know where the ball is going, are a great way to perfect the technical aspects of your strokes.\nFor example, after spending a few sessions working on your forehand and backhand drives your technique has probably improved quite a bit. You can now keep a rally going, on the diagonals, and have tried playing the stroke down the line. Adding in a regular movement exercise, such as “backhand, middle, backhand, wide” or “two forehands, two backhands” is a great way to continue to practice your forehand and backhand drives in a slightly different context. The focus is still primarily on improving your basic technique but the variation in the movement drill will stop the process seeming so repetitive and tedious.\nIn this sense the drill is really being used as a bit of a cover-up. The primary objective is the same as before (when you were playing your strokes just on the diagonal), to improve your technique, but the pattern of the drill and the small amount of movement helps the learning process and increases your concentration and motivation.\nAs you improve, and master more difficult strokes, the regular movement drill should still be your first port of call after you have practiced a particular stroke or skill in isolation. So, once you have had a go at your forehand topspin and you feel you are making progress technically, then it’s time to set yourself a regular movement drill (such as “forehand wide, forehand middle”) and continue to practice your technique in a different context. This process can and should be applied to all of the new strokes and skills you acquire until they become automatic and you can perform them without conscious thought.\n2. Regular movement drills to increase confidence (and help to “get your eye in”) in advanced players.\nOnce you have become an advanced player, and have mastered all of the various table tennis strokes, I think it’s time to stop relying on regular movement drills in your practice. You certainly shouldn’t be spending the bulk of your session practicing these types of drills.\nPersonally, looking back over my development as a player, I think this is a piece of advice I wish I’d had as a teenager. I probably reached this “advanced” stage at about 16. I had mastered all of the strokes; I could drive, push, topspin, loop, block, counter, open-up, lob, serve and receive serve quite well. It was now time for me to begin using all of these tools to start developing a style of play, learning how to control points and ultimately win matches and succeed in tournaments. Unfortunately, blissfully unaware that there was anything beyond regular movement drills, I continued to practice them and got better and better at performing them. It wasn’t until I moved to Grantham at 18 that I really saw all of the other ways to practice. I remember being painfully bad at any irregular drill that was set because I was so used to always knowing where the ball would go in practice. I also had this terrible habit of constantly backing away from the table in matches, as if the unexpected change of direction of the ball was constantly surprising me (which of course, it was).\nThat little story is a good example of when table tennis drills\nare\na waste of time. Certain types of drills, for certain players, at least. I probably wasted much of the two years (from 16-18) doing those types of drills when I should have been working on the irregular part of my game, experimenting with spin/feeling and things like loop-to-loop, and planning points and my preferred methods of service and return.\nDon’t make the same mistake.\nMy advice is this; regular movement drills should be used sparingly by advanced players. I recommend using one for five minutes at the start of a session (as a sort of warm-up, “getting your eye in” type exercise) or before matches at a tournament, to give you a bit of a boost in confidence and calm your nerves. The problem is that for advanced players regular movement drills can become a sort of crutch. They make you feel like you’re playing well and give you an inflated view of how good you are by making your practice too easy. You may leave the session thinking, “I was playing really well today” but in fact it’s just that you gave yourself a beginners practice session. And for an advanced player, a beginners practice session is a waste of time.\nThe other problem I come across occasionally are players that spend all their time practicing regular drills (or sometimes even just playing a stroke along a diagonal), never satisfied with their technique. They appear to be lost on a long journey to perfection and they never seem to get any closer to their destination. This, too, is a waste of time. Despite the importance of technique in table tennis, table tennis is not a sport where winners and losers are decided on the prettiness of their technique (such as diving or gymnastics). There comes a point where your technique is good enough and you need to focus your effort on other things. For advanced players this mean not becoming obsessed with the hunt for perfection in certain strokes.\n3. Irregular movement drills to test technique in intermediate players.\nIn the same way that regular movement drills are a waste of time for advanced players, irregular movement drills are a waste of time for beginners. If you’re a beginner stay away from these for now!\nA few times, as a young coach, I got a bit ahead of myself with some of my players and started setting them irregular drills when they really weren’t ready for them. It would either lead to a lack of confidence/despair in the player (struggling and failing to perform the drill) or it would causes them to lose all of their previously good technique as their attention shifted to the moving ball and they slowly reversed the positive effects of their previous training.\nHowever, irregular movement drills can be great for intermediate players! If you are a player that can hit 100 forehands in a row, you’ve mastered the basic footwork/movement patterns and you can be consistent and accurate playing shots like a topspin and block then it’s time you started pushing yourself with some irregular drills.\nI think these irregular drills work really well for testing technique. If you can perform the irregular movement drills without your technique deteriorating then you are truly on your way to mastering that particular stroke or skill. If the irregular nature of the drill leads you to alter your technique then you know that you’re not quite there yet. Remember, when you play a match the ball is going to be completely irregular in it’s direction!\n4. Irregular movement drills to improve anticipation, speed, agility, balance (and everything else) in advanced players.\nIt’s definitely easier to come up with regular drills than irregular drills. As I coach I know this too well. However, if you are an advanced player, looking to improve any part of your game, I really believe you should be using irregular drills. Therefore, here I’m recommending the use of irregular drills (rather than regular drills) for advanced players that are trying to improve a certain aspect of their performance.\nThis use of drills is going to require a lot more planning and analysing than just saying “lets do an irregular drill, how about “one or two to the backhand, one to the forehand”. If we use drills in that way we are thinking about drills first instead of first understanding the problem or area we want to work on and then thinking about a drill we can come up with to tackle it.\nA better way of practicing would be to think, “I have trouble hitting powerful backhand topspins down the line”. This is the problem and this is where we will start. Then, instead of just asking your partner to block with their forehand while you topspin backhands down the line, you need to think, “What kind of irregular drill can I use to help me practice and improve my backhand topspin down the line?”. My point is that if you simply get your partner to block with their forehand down the line for five minutes you may well finish the drill feeling like you’ve improved on a weakness. But often I think you’ll find that once you get back into a match scenario that backhand down the line is still troubling you and you don’t have the confidence to execute it.\nAs an example, here’s the sort of drill you could come up with…\nYou play a forehand counter to counter rally with your partner. At any point during the rally (which you are both playing at 80-90% of maximum speed) your partner can switch the ball down the line with either a block or a counter-topspin. You then move across and play a backhand topspin down the line (avoiding the temptation to either block the ball, which is too passive, or play a backhand topspin across the table, which is the predictable angle).\nI believe that if irregular drills are used in this way, as a means to solving another problem and not as an end in themselves, then we’ll really be getting the most out of our practice.\n5. Service and receive drills to create table tennis “plays” and help advanced players to plan their points.\nThis will be my final point of the article because I realise that it’s getting rather long!\nIf you’ve joined the\nExpert Table Tennis Academy\n, subscribing to my newsletter and getting yourself a free copy of my eBook (\nThe Table Tennis Playbook\n), you’ll know all about my thoughts on the importance of planning your points and creating a few favourite “plays”.\nIn many other sports large chunks of training time are spent going through such plays or set-pieces that are constructed as plans to score goals or touchdowns or baskets. The reason they spend so much time working on these plays is that the plays lead directly to more points in a game, and more points in a game leads to winning games. I believe that the training of advanced table tennis players should follow these principles more closely.\nTechnique should be near enough sorted. Fitness levels should be high and just requiring maintenance. Now is the time for tactics! And service and receive drills are excellent for creating these winning tactics and “plays”.\nSo, if you count yourself as an advanced table tennis player I ask you this question…\nIs your practice built around the principles of trying to find ways to win more points?\nBecause in table tennis there are no points for looking pretty.\nIt’s no good being a great practice partner if you can’t do it in the tournament hall.\nSo what now?\nI hope that this post has given you something to chew over. I’ve certain had plenty of new ideas since I started writing it!\nMy next post (which will hopefully go live in a few days time) will be looking at some alternative methods of table tennis practice. I’m going to be thinking about some other things we could be doing in our practice time that may help us to develop faster and become better players.\nBefore then, I’d love to hear your opinion on this article and your thoughts on how best to maximise our table tennis practice time.\nAnd for those of you that can still remember back to the first few paragraphs of this post… Here’s the photo.\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this!\nAnd as I said already, please let me know your thoughts. The comments box below is a great place to leave your opinion and start a discussion.\nPart 2 coming soon…"

    "title": "Upgrade Your Table Tennis Practice",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nAugust 20, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nUpgrade Your Table Tennis Practice\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nUpgrade Your Table Tennis Practice\nIn my last post, “\nAre Table Tennis Drills a Waste of Time\n“, I attempted to objectively look at the effectiveness of the drills we perform in our practice sessions.\nIt was quite a long post (“You can say that again!”) but the gist of it was this;\ndrills aren’t always a waste of time, in fact in some circumstances they can be extremely useful, but our reliance on them as players and coaches means that we don’t always use them in an optimal way.\nToday’s post is the follow-on from that and my aim is to examine a couple of alternative methods of practice that we can apply to our own training.\nYou may not have heard of players training like this before (and perhaps you even don’t agree with some of the following methods) but my intention, as with the previous post, is to put out some suggestions that may help get you thinking and questioning your normal routine.\nI’ll be tackling two main big ideas that should help you make the most of your practice time and maximise your potential development.\nBut first, I’d quickly like to tackle an area that I think it very important to your practice in general; time efficiency or productivity.\nIn most other areas of life we are keen to be productive. In our work, in particular, we make sure that we make good use of the time we have and set ourselves clear start and end times to stop tasks from dragging on. However, my observations from our table tennis practice are quite the opposite and I see this repeatedly in emails I receive. It appears that a lot of the time, in the practice hall, we are waiting around, resting, chatting to others, playing a match with another player (when we want to be practicing something), or blocking for somebody (when we want to be playing matches).\nOf course, table tennis is fun and we enjoy ourselves when we are playing or at our club so time doesn’t seem to be such an issue. But…\nIf we are serious about upgrading our practice then this is something we need to tackle head on. And…\nIf we are counting practice hours in search of that elusive 10,000 hours (as pointed out my Malcolm Gladwell, Matthew Syed and others), then we need to be making sure we’re not adding any “empty” hours.\nHere are a few recommendations to improve the time efficiency of your practice…\nIncrease the frequency of your practice and decrease the duration.\nWhat I mean here is instead of practicing two evenings a week for 3 hours a time (adding up to 6 hours a week), how about practicing six days a week but only for 1 hour at a time. I really believe that this is something that we should be trying out and encouraging. We should work very hard for 60 minutes and then leave instead of working somewhat hard for 3 hours and then having a few days off! I wrote a post about my idea of “\n60 Minute Table Tennis\n” a while back which you can read if you’re interested.\nRemove breaks.\nIf you are training for shorter duration’s (see above) then you really shouldn’t need to take such long breaks. Take a drink to the table with you and catch 30 seconds or so here and there. The problem with a short break is that often it turns into a very long one before we’ve even realised!\nPlan you sessions before you arrive.\nI think that much practice time is wasted either thinking of what to practice or practicing something that isn’t worthwhile because you couldn’t think of anything else to do. Spend the time drawing up some kind of weekly programme for yourself to follow or at least think through what you want to accomplish in the session before you arrive at the venue. This will certainly save time.\nThink about investing in some one-to-one coaching.\nThis can be a huge time-saver and perhaps not as expensive as you think. If you were to pay £5 a time for your 3 hour practice session twice a week, plus a couple of quid in travel each way that would add up to about £18 spent, per week, on your two sessions. There’s a good chance that for £20 you’d be able to get yourself a one-to-one session each week! This could save you five hours of weekly practice time and the one-to-one attention of the coach would probably lead you to improve faster than continuing with your current routine anyway.\nFind a club with plenty of tables.\nI know that many clubs are quite small and have a system where you turn up, have a chat, sit down, wait for a table, and then have 20 minutes or so to practice before you feel like you should come off to let someone else have a go. As “nice” and “friendly” as this is it is not the kind of environment that is going to lead to big improvements in your performance. Find a club with lots of tables where you can turn up with a partner and play solidly for a good period of time.\nNow that I’ve got that off my chest, lets move on with the bulk of the post.\nHere are my two big suggestions for upgrading your practice. They are alternatives to the generally accepted norm of turning up, doing a few drills, getting a sweat on, playing some games and then going home. I haven’t tried everything out myself (or with my players) yet but I’ll be looking to implement them this coming season and feedback on how well I think they have worked.\n1. Only play matches… but video them (and analyze them)\nThis was an idea I had a couple of weeks ago and it stemmed from me thinking about the well-known conflict between the young player and coach.\nOften a passionate and enthusiastic young player will want to play many matches in training. They want to play their friends. They want to compete. They enjoy being able to apply all aspects of the sport (the serve, the tactics, the reactions) and are often less interested in drills which seem a bit tedious and pointless. After all, “Tim never puts the ball only into my forehand-two-thirds in a game, does he?”.\nAs a coach we tell our players we know better. “Drills are important”, we say. “You’ll never become a good player if all you want to do is play matches”. And it’s true, to an extent. The players that just play matches all the time usually have poor technique and end up losing when they go back up against their peers that spent the time learning how to play.\nAnd no wonder they do… because the players that just play matches never get any feedback and they rarely get much coaching.\nThis got me thinking…\nIs there a way that we could incorporate coaching and feedback into the “I just want to play matches” mentality. And…\nIf we did give these players feedback and clear instructions on how to improve could they make the same improvements in their matches, if they saw the matches as just another method of improvement, rather than being all about winning. After all, at tournaments we often tell players that it’s not all about winning (it’s about applying the techniques and tactics they’ve learnt) and that results doesn’t determine success. And often it is after tournaments, where the coach analyses a performance in a match-setting, that they really understand what the player needs to improve. Also, it is often following tournaments that players say that they learnt the most about their game and what they should be working on.\nAll of this has lead me to the following conclusion on matches in practice…\nIt’s not the playing of matches that is a waste of time, it’s the\nmindless\nplaying of matches.\nThe reason we learn so much from our tournament experience is that our performances are being analyzed and we (the players) are more engaged in the mindset of thinking about our performance and receiving feedback.\nOK, so perhaps to\nonly\nplay matches wouldn’t be the ideal solution but I think that playing lots of matches in training, and then spending the time to give feedback and reflect on the match (this is the important part), should be a vital element in our practice. We should be playing practice matches… and filming practice matches… and watching our practice matches… and going through them with a coach until we understand our faults and how to correct them completely.\nLets make practice as similar to tournaments as possible and this is one way to do it!\n2. Mess around with some deliberate play\nTable tennis player, coach and sports psychologist,\nMark Simpson, wrote a post all about the idea of deliberate play\n(on this blog) back in January 2013.\nSince then I’ve started looking into it in more detail and even incorporating slots of 15 minutes or so into my coaching sessions, where I give the players free time to spend doing whatever they like. The things they came up with were quite ingenious. You had all the usual loop-to-loop and lobbing and smashing but then some would also invent their own games (such as table tennis tennis, which is played on the floor with a barrier as a net), or spend the time trying out a trick serve or trying to hit a round-the-net winner.\nPersonally, I feel that this kind of practice is ahead of its time and will be much more common in the future, when we understand it a bit more. However, I still think we should be including it in our practice.\nHow about, the next time to turn up at your club for a session, decide that you wont do any drills or play any matches. Instead you are going to experiment, be creative and just have a lot of fun.\n(You’ll need to make sure you’re there with someone else that’s equally happy to try this out, otherwise you might find the other players at the club find you rather irritating!)\nFrom a personal point of view I have seen this type of practice work wonders in one of my players. Growing up in a smallish club where he was arguably the best (and most talented) player from about the age of 12/13, he spent much of his time messing around, trying ridiculous shots and having fun. Very rarely would you see him actually get his head down and practice a particular drill (and if he did he’d usually lose interest after a couple of minutes). Despite the lack of traditional coaching and practice partners his talent, creativity and general love of the sport saw him continually climb the rankings. He would beat players that took the sport much more seriously than him and he would often be admired by others at tournaments for his unique style of play and flair for the game.\nThe result of all that messing around was a very confident player with an incredible feeling for the ball and a great understanding of all the spins that could be imparted onto it. He then used this confidence and relaxed playing style to beat many of the top players in his age group (and even a few very highly ranked seniors).\nThe point is… perhaps messing around isn’t such as bad idea after all. It all goes in somehow.\nThese guys certainly know a thing or two about messing around in a table tennis hall, so if you are after some ideas then look no further…\nI’m going to stop there today, because we’re hitting the 2,000 word-mark again and I know that not everyone enjoys such long posts, but I will be back writing about this whole idea again as it is one I am very interested in at the moment.\nI would love you to leave a comment below and let me know your thoughts on these two big ideas (using matches and video analysis in practice and messing around/deliberate play).\nHave you done either of these before in your practice sessions or are you going to give them a try now?\nAs I said, when school starts up again in two weeks time I will be using these methods with my group of players and I’ll let you know how they are getting on with them. I believe that both could really help in the overall development of a player, so if you’re serious about improving… give them a go!"

This time I didn’t have to. He came up with this idea all by himself! It’s clearly something he has been thinking about a lot recently.\nI’ll hand you right over to Sam now, and I hope you enjoy reading some of his thoughts. He wanted to start off with a few quotes…\n“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.” –\nAlbert Einstein\n“The better I get at table tennis, the more I realise how much better I need to get.” –\nSam Priestley\n“That was really useful. I’ve identified three new things you really need to improve on.” –\nBen Larcombe\n(after every match I play)\nWhen everything needs work\nIf you were to record everything that was said in one of our table tennis sessions, it would probably sound a bit like this;\nYou didn’t swivel your hips.\nThat was too much shoulder.\nYou pivoted on your right foot.\nYou’re too stiff.\nYou didn’t use your wrist.\nYou snatched at that.\nYou took that too late.\nYou need to get lower.\nStick your bum out.\nYou didn’t move your feet.\nYou moved in the wrong direction.\nYou should’ve stepped in.\nYou should’ve stepped back.\nYou need to get more side on to the ball.\nYou need to stay more square to the table.\nThe thing is, if you recorded a session a couple of months ago it probably would have sounded exactly the same, except that the list would have been half as long! Am I just getting worse?\nI’m not, every week I have improved but at each step we discover more problems, problems that only appear because I’m getting good enough for them to matter.\nTable tennis is just really hard to perfect. Just knowing a problem exists doesn’t mean that it’s solved. Table tennis movements and anticipations aren’t natural. They may look natural to the top players but that is because they have spent so many hours practicing them that they have overwritten the body’s natural programming. You can’t just watch a YouTube video and expect to replicate what you see. You need to practice, practice, practice (and practice some more), forcing the improvement into your muscles until your natural reaction is to do the shot correctly.\nLet’s take and examine just one of the problems I have;\nI tend to throw my shoulder when doing a forehand rather than snapping from legs, hips and elbow.\nThis is something I have been working to fix for a couple of months now. It is a problem that has caused me injury (I have lost probably about a weeks worth of training due to shoulder complaints). I know how to do the shot correctly, and I don’t throw my shoulder most of the time now, but in the heat of a match or when responding to an unexpected shot my body betrays me and I ‘naturally’ throw my shoulder.\nWe might spend a session working on the problem, and it gets a lot better, but then in the next session we move onto something else and a week later the problem is back. What we really want is to be able to spend 20 hours forcing each technique adjustment into muscle memory. But we can’t spend 20 hours on everything!\nSo, what can we do about a growing list of problems? How do we fix everything?\nAccept you will always have stuff to improve. While in Denmark this summer, Lei Yang, the German team’s technical coach, told us that Timo Boll’s forehand is “little bit wrong”. If Timo Boll still has flaws he is trying to work on then how many more will we have?\nPrioritise which flaws will have the greatest impact on your game.\nWork just on the top three flaws. Research suggests that working on two or three things helps the brain learn better than if you just focused on one.Even when you think they’re fixed keep thinking about them and working on them! It takes a long time to for movements to become truly automatic.\nReprioritise your flaws and repeat.\nHere is my current priority list:\nReceiving long, slow spinny serves to my backhand.\nTransferring my weight when I play a forehand shot.\nDigging.\n(and another 127 things that also need work)\nI have probably 30 hours (only!) of training time left between now and the end of the challenge. Let’s see if that’s enough time to dramatically improve these three."

    "title": "High Intensity Table Tennis and 60 Minute Practice",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nFebruary 1, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHigh Intensity Table Tennis and 60 Minute Practice\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHigh Intensity Table Tennis and 60 Minute Practice\nToday I’m thinking about our training volume and intensity. This is a concept that has been around for decades in bodybuilding training but I don’t feel is discussed enough in skill-based sports such as table tennis.\nThe basic argument is this; is it better to practice for several hours each day but at a relatively low intensity (volume training) or to practice for much less time but work significantly harder in those short sessions (intensity training). In current professional table tennis practice it appears that there is a clear winner. Volume training. The top players claim to practice for anywhere from 25 to 45 hours per week and rightly so, we say, because it is their ‘job’ after all.\nThe questions I’m asking are; “Is it necessary to practice for 5-7 hours a day in order to become a top player?”. Are there any shortcuts or hacks we can use to achieve similar results with a much lower volume of practice? Does high intensity training hold any of the answers and can it be applied to table tennis?\nThe Bodybuilding Training War (Schwarzenegger vs Mentzer)\nWe’ve all heard of Arnold Schwarzenegger, right? But have you heard of Mike Mentzer? During the late 70’s and early 80’s they found themselves in a bit of a battle in regards to training styles. Arnie had long been a believer in high-volume training, pumping iron, and spending hours upon hours in the gym each week. Mentzer, on the other hand, was challenging this idea and advocating more intense workouts. A Mentzer workout would last only 20-30 minutes!\nWhich style had the best results? Well, in the end there wasn’t much between them. Throughout the years bodybuilding champions have come and gone. Some have achieved with volume training, others with intensity training. Even to this day, both training styles are widely used and supported.\nHigh Intensity Table Tennis?\nThe concept has definitely been proven in bodybuilding and strength environments and\nit’s started to become accepted in endurance and fitness circles as well\n. The question I’m interested in is, can we find a way to adapt table tennis practice to fit the high-intensity model?\nThe need for it is clear! Table tennis is a sport without much financial support or funding. Most players are not professionals and do not have 5-7 hours per day to spend practicing. Children have to fit their practice around schoolwork while the rest of us have work or university to contend with. It becomes very hard for players to become professional as they simply don’t have the time needed to dedicate to practice.\nBut does the high-intensity philosophy work in skill-based sports? Do you need to spend hours and hours practicing each week in order to maintain your touch, feeling and coordination? At the moment I don’t have the answers to those questions but I hope to find out.\n60 Minute Table Tennis\nMy idea for high intensity table tennis is called, ’60 Minute Table Tennis’. It’s based around the premise that even though we may not be able to play full-time, all of us can spare one hour a day, six days a week, to practice our table tennis. If this hour is used super-productively in a high-intensity, planned session, there is a good chance we could see huge improvement to our game while stile maintaining our 9 to 5 job or our studies.\nWhen put alongside the ‘volume training’ principle of 10,000 hours, 60 Minute Table Tennis definitely comes up short! If followed completely you would clock up a mere 312 hours a year practicing table tennis using this method, meaning it would take you just over 32 years to achieve ‘expert’ status. By this point you’d be well past your peak physically and probably would have already given up if you hadn’t seen significant results during the first 25 years!\nHowever, I think that it would be possible to develop with just 60 minutes of practice per day, provided the practice was of a very high intensity, breaks were very short (if used at all) and sessions were planed and focused to work on your key areas.\nConclusion\nSo those are my thoughts. You may think I’m a bit crazy but this is definitely something that I’m going to be looking into. I’m hoping to speak to a few sport scientists that know their way around this topic and run the theory of high intensity practice in skill-based sports by them and see what they come up with in regards to rapid development.\nIf you’ve got any questions or comments please\ndrop me a line\n. Thanks for reading."

    "title": "Physical Training for Table Tennis",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMarch 22, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nPhysical Training for Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nPhysical Training for Table Tennis\nI still haven’t quite decided how important physical table tennis training is for table tennis players. There’s no question that elite-level players need to be doing physical training but should beginners and intermediate-level players be allocating any time to it?\nI think my opinion of physical training for beginners and improvers has gone down over time. I used to think it was quite important. Of course all table tennis players should be working on their fitness and speed and strength and power. I would say that your physical condition should always be brilliant as this is only going to have a positive effect on your performance.\nI still believe this to be true. Being a true athlete in great shape definitely isn’t going to negatively effect your table tennis development, but should beginners and improvers that aren’t in the best of shape dedicate precious training hours of physical training, away from the table, or would they be better off just spending more time actually playing table tennis? Really the question is…\nIs physical training a good use of training time?\nFor most of us, non-professional players, we only have so much time in a week that we can dedicate to table tennis. Let’s imagine you can spare five hours a week to try and improve your table tennis. Is it worth spending any of that time in the gym or doing plyometric-type exercises to improve your fitness? I’m not sure it is. I think you would probably see greater improvements from dedicating the full five hours to on-the-table practice.\nThis is definitely what we have decided upon with Sam’s training for the\nExpert in a Year challenge\n. There was a point, back in April or May or something like that, when Sam was doing daily physical training in the gym. He has doing speed work, plyometric jumps, and we were even talking about adding some cardio into his gym plan. The problem was that Sam is a pretty busy guy, and we were ending up playing less table tennis so that he had time to get him gym stuff done. Then on other days he would come into a training session shattered before we had even started.\nIt’s not that physical training was bad for him, it’s just that there are only so many hours in the day! When he started going to clubs are losing matches to players that he wanted to beat we didn’t think, “Right, we really need to add some extra physical to your training!” We were both aware that it wasn’t Sam physical condition that was preventing him from winning his matches, and it’s probably not yours that’s holding you back either. More likely, it’s Sam’s technical and tactical ability that will results in better results in his matches and therefore it makes sense for us to focus on that.\nSo, as far as I’m concerned, if you are a beginner or improver (novice up to about county/regional standard) I wouldn’t worry at all about off-the-table physical training. By all means do some overspeed multiball drills or similar on-the-table exercises that are physically challenging but I don’t think loads of gym work is going to make a huge difference to your game. This is one thing that separates table tennis from the majority of sports.\nPhysical training for advanced/elite players\nIf you’re a high-level player who has been playing competitively for a number of years and is trying to reach the top then I think you are in a different situation. You are probably training for table tennis pretty much every day and you are dedicated more time to it in your average week than a beginner or local-level player.\nElite players need physical training for two reasons;\nTo maximise their performance and give them the extra speed and power needed to compete at the highest level.\nTo give them the strength and stamina they’ll need to train hard, daily, and avoid injuries.\nIf you feel like you fall into this category of player (you are playing at a high level and training at least four times per week) then here are some tips for table tennis specific physical training you could add to your weekly programme.\nShort sprints\nTrain laterally\nPlyometrics\nDevelop arm speed\nTrain quick\nIf those five suggestions interest you I recommend you read a previous guest post by table tennis coach and personal trainer, Steve Brunskill, entitled\n5 Tips to Improve Your Table Tennis Fitness\n. I also wrote an article on\nplyometric training for table tennis players\nfor the website TableTennisMaster which you should have a look at.\nSummary\nI guess what this discussion really comes down to is how much do you believe the advice that…\n“If you want to be the best you need to train like the best”\nOn a surface level this sounds like good advice but I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently and I’m not quite sure it is.\nFor starters, the “best” players have been training for many years, usually 10+. For you to try and match the volume and intensity of their training is like buying a one-way ticket to over-training and burnout. You see this pretty much at any intensive summer camp. After a few days of training loads of players have injuries or are just sore and over-tired. Progression is important. You need to get your body used to that level of volume and intensity of training over time.\nYou also need to think about differences between the goals of elite players and yourself. Chances are, the majority of elite players are simply trying to maintain their level of play and keep themselves sharp. They don’t need to improve their technique or footwork because they already have those things sorted. The training they are doing, and especially the physical training they are doing, has been designed to compliment their individual goals and targets. You probably have completely different goals and areas you need to focus on.\nSo I would say, don’t worry too much about physical training as a beginner or improver. First increase you table time and quality practice. You’ll see plenty of very good players you are clearly out of shape and unfit, and it hasn’t held them back from reaching their current level.\nObviously at the top level you don’t see these unfit players and somewhere along your table tennis career you will need to start adding physical training into your schedule. Once you feel that you physical conditioning is holding you back from progressing in the sport, then it’s time to think about tackling it!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nAugust 8, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n5 Tips to Improve Your Table Tennis Fitness & Train Like an Athlete!\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n5 Tips to Improve Your Table Tennis Fitness & Train Like an Athlete!\nThis post is all about the physical side of our sport – table tennis fitness, to be specific – and to make this article the best it can be I’ve enlisted the help of an expert, Steve Brunskill.\nSteve is a table tennis coach and personal trainer – so he ought to know a thing or two about table tennis fitness. If you’re from the UK you have probably heard of Steve already. He was the head coach of\nOrmesby Table Tennis Club\n(one of the biggest and most successful clubs in the UK) and is now the head coach at\nSwerve TTC\n.\nSteve has played at a high-level himself and coached many top athletes. Even now, despite his efforts being focused on coaching, he maintains a ranking of around 100 on the England Senior list and finds himself inside the top 25 veterans in the country!\nOn the fitness side of things, Steve holds numerous qualifications and certificates in areas such as; weight training, fitness instructing, fitness assessing, writing sports programs, nutrition, sports therapy and sports massage. As a coach, I’m sure this gives him a broad and holistic view of the training process and how best to work with his players.\nAnyway, that’s enough about Steve for now. If you would like to find out more about him I’ll include some links at the end of the post. This guest post is all about some easy to implement tips that will help you improve your table tennis fitness. So, for now, it’s over to Steve!\nTable Tennis Fitness\nDesigning a fitness programme for table tennis is just the same as designing a fitness programme for any other sport. Firstly, you need to decide the specific type of fitness required. You’ll need to address the following questions;\n1. What are the main muscles used?\n2. What types of movements are used?\n3. Which energy system is used?\n4. Which muscle fibre type is used?\n5. What stage of the season is it?\nHowever, table tennis is not as straight forward as many other sports. Factors such as the high skill level required, the shortness of each point, the short duration of a game, and the length of the season can make things more difficult. The level of ability and effort level of the participant also plays a major part.\nSo for the purpose of what I am about to write: it is based on the pre-season phase of training, for a player of good ability, who has been playing for several years, and who wishes to improve and climb the ranking list to become a top player. I am also assuming that the player already has a good base level of general fitness.\nTo become a top table tennis player you need to become an athlete, just as you would in any other sport. I think most people are familiar with the term\n“you are what you eat”,\nwell the same applies to training; “you become how you train”. Train slow, you become slow. Train fast, you become fast.\nTable tennis is a reaction/speed game that requires explosive anaerobic movements which must make up the main specific type of training programme that is required.\nMy first observation of players/coaches standard table tennis fitness training is that it is usually based on general fitness, with lots of running (from 800m to a couple of miles). This uses our red twitch/slow twitch muscle fibres and the movements used have very little resemblance to that used when playing table tennis.\nTo combat this I have created these five tips that will help you to make your table tennis fitness training more relevant and specific to our sport.\n1. Short sprints\nBreak your running distances down into short sprints of 10, 20, 30 and 40 metres. Repeat these sprints several times and allow plenty of time to recover in-between bouts. I\nt’s no good running tired because this will only make you run slower, which defeats the object.\nA lot of players don’t realise that the latest evidence has shown that short intense sprinting improves cardiovascular and endurance in about half the time as traditional cardiovascular training, such as long distance running and cycling. So even if you are only trying to improve your “general level of fitness”, sprinting is probably still the best way to go about it!\nSprinting improves strength, power and limb speed, which are all vital for table tennis. It also helps to build lean muscle mass, while reducing body fat and working the anaerobic system.\nTable tennis is a high-intensity sport (as is sprinting). Table tennis also requires explosive power (as does sprinting). So you can see there are a lot of similarities in the training benefits.\n2. Train laterally\nTable tennis is mainly a lateral movement game\n(meaning the main directions of movements are side to side).\nSo, as I said at the beginning,\n“you become how you train\n”. A lot of your table tennis fitness training needs to be made up of lateral movements, such as lateral jumping.\nTraining laterally increases your ability to change direction quickly, improves leg strength, explosive power, stability, balance and coordination. Basically,\neverything you need to play table tennis!\n3. Use lots of jumping and bounding movements\nAdd jumping exercises to your fitness programme, such as tuck jumps. These are great for improving your dynamic power and agility. They also need no equipment and can be performed when you only have a limited amount of space. You can adapt them in many ways by using different leg positions such as a pike jump or split jump. You can also add sprints and sidestep movements on landing. These are probably the best types of exercises for developing explosive power.\nJumping on and off boxes is another way to advance your jumping training and increase explosive power. Known as plyometrics, and used by most top athletes, this is an advanced form of training which is very good for strengthening the tendons and ligaments, and developing joint stability.\n(I wrote a post about plyometrics for table tennis myself a while back. You can read that\nhere\nif you would like to – Ben).\n4. Develop arm speed\nI am a great believer in the importance arm speed when playing table tennis. Players need fast acceleration in the shoulder, elbow and wrist. Resistance training bands are great for training arm speed and acceleration because they allow the player to mimic the movements of a stroke and target the specific muscles required to execute the shot. The gradual increase in tension of the band makes the trainer increase the speed against the resistance and improve their acceleration of the stroke.\nThe use of heavy bats can also help with arm speed and increase the power of shots but the band gives a safer option as it offers a steady increase and decrease in resistance.\nAlso, don’t rule out weight training! The Chinese train with weights and understand the incredible benefits weights can add to explosive power and speed. Contrary to what many people think, the use of heavy weights moved fast in the positive phase and controlled in the negative phase increases power and speed and can be a great benefit to table tennis players. You don’t need to just stick to using light weights with high repetitions.\n5. Train quick\nGeneral conditioning exercises; such as press ups, sit ups, lunges, squats etc. are all great for table tennis. However, the emphasis should be on speed, quickness and explosiveness, rather than simply good technique of exercise. Just have the player blast 6 quick press ups several times or add bounces to the press up or a jump to the squats. There are many ways to make these types of exercises more suited to developing explosive power.\nIn conclusion, I believe table tennis players need to become athletes. They need to eat like athletes and train like athletes.\nTraining should, where possible, mimic the sport we play. Table tennis is a short, sharp, explosive game that uses anaerobic lateral movements with balance, agility and coordination. Remember this when you are next working on your table tennis fitness!\nSteve Brunskill\nA huge thank you to Steve for that really interesting post.

    "title": "Technical Training for Table Tennis",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMarch 3, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTechnical Training for Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTechnical Training for Table Tennis\nI believe to become an expert table tennis player you must master the four aspects of the game (technical, tactical, physical and mental). An expert is proficient in all four areas and can be described as a ‘complete’ player. The first and most important aspect of the game to master is technique.\nTable tennis is a highly technical sport. If you fail to master the fundamental techniques of the game you are likely to seriously disadvantage yourself as you attempt to improve your level of play and move up to a higher level. This is why it’s ideal to learn a correct technique from the start.\nHowever, I understand that for many of us that wasn’t an option. If you weren’t fortunate enough to find yourself at an established club with experienced and knowledgeable coaches when you started, then there’s a good chance you had to improvise with your technique, picking up bits and pieces from other players and doing your best to copy the better players around you. Fear not! It’s possible to relearn the fundamental technique even if you’ve been playing for years, it’s just going to require some hard work and motivation to change. But first…\nWhy is technique important?\nYou may have had a coach or other player tell you that your technique on a certain stroke is not right before. Perhaps you agreed with them. But maybe you didn’t really see the problem. After all, your shots are still going on the table! And maybe your slightly unorthodox playing style actually makes it more difficult for your opponent, you think. Well, much of that may be true, but here are a couple of reasons why ‘good’ table tennis technique is important.\nTo improve efficiency\nHave you ever played one of those hotshot twelve year olds who’s in the national team for their age group and is tearing up the local senior players despite being only four foot tall and weighing 35kg. You watch them playing and think to yourself, “How on earth do they get so much power? There’s nothing to them!” Well, they aren’t super-children, they simply have ‘perfect’ technique. Chances are they’ve had some really good coaching and been shown how to generate maximum power from their small frame.\nGood technique is efficient. It gives skinny twelve year olds more power than beefy thirty year olds who aren’t using their body correctly. Mastering a solid technique can give you…\nMore power\nMore spin\nMore control\nFaster movement\nQuicker strokes\nIt adds that extra level of ‘quality’ to your game. You are still going to be making the same decisions and playing the same strokes (most of the time), but you’ll be able to hit harder (making it easier to finish off points), generate more spin (making your serves and your topspins, in particular, much more dangerous), develop greater control (making it easier to keep the ball on the table), get to the ball faster and play shots in quick succession (making it more difficult for your opponent to react).\nAnd finally, being ‘efficient’ in your play will feel much better. You’ll get a much nicer feeling when you play your shots and feel more ‘free’ in your play.\nTo reduce the chance of injury\nI used to think that improving efficiency was the sole reason for technique and at a beginner level I think that is largely true. However, once you start playing table tennis at a higher level, and consequently at a higher intensity, your technique becomes a big factor in the chance of you getting injured. High level table tennis is fast, powerful and explosive. If you are repeatedly doing all of these movements with a sub-optimal technique you are much more likely to get injured.\nThis could well be the reason why you hardly ever see international level players with ‘terrible’ technique. In order to reach that level you have to practice so much, and compete so often, that if your technique was seriously wrong I reckon there’s a good chance you wouldn’t make it. You would either injure yourself repeatedly, until you correct your technique, or you’d injure yourself badly which could stop your from playing.\nLei Yang, one of the coaches on the B75 training camp in Denmark and also the technical coach for the German national team, would always link my errors in technique to injury. He would say, “If you play so tense, in your shoulders, you going to get injury.” When I pulled a muscle in my back on the fifth day of training he said to me, “This is because you always too tense.” He also said that Timo Boll’s technique is not perfect and this is the reason that he is struggling with injuries recently. Have you ever noticed that the top Chinese players seem to have careers that go on forever? Players like Wang Liqin are still among the best in the world, and injury free, in their late thirties. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they spend so much time perfecting their technique.\nHow to improve your technique\nI hope that you now understand the importance of having a correct technique. I should point out again that\nI don’t believe that technique is the only important aspect of training\n. If you have brilliant technique but your tactical, physical and mental game is poor then you are very unlikely to become anything more than a mediocre player. But technique is a great place to start and once you have strong foundations you can begin to build the rest of your game (tactics, physical conditioning and mental strength) around it.\nI will break technique down into four different areas; grip, stance, footwork, and strokes.\n1. Grip\nThe first thing to master is how to hold your bat. I have always thought grip was really important, perhaps even I’ve over-emphasised the importance of having a ‘correct’ grip, but it is something that plenty of beginners and recreational players struggle with.\nI should point out that there are two orthodox and accepted grips in table tennis; shake-hands (aka European) and penhold (aka Asian), although now many Asian players also use a shake-hands grip. I have very little experience with the penhold grip and therefore I coach the shake-hands technique.\nI have always been really big on promoting a ‘neutral’ grip. I wrote\na blog post all about why it’s important to have a neutral grip\ninstead of a backhand or forehand dominant one. I still believe that is true but I think I’m going to need to rewrite that post.\nTo quickly summarise my thoughts on grip; I used to think it was super important to be 100% neutral in your grip. I would tell my players that their grip was slightly forehand dominant and this might make backhand difficult, or they had a backhand grip and this could make it difficult to generate as much power on the forehand. Now I think it’s okay to be slightly forehand or backhand dominant, as long as you have a relatively neutral grip that allows you to play both forehands and backhands.\nHowever, I have found something else that I think is super important, and that is the part of your hand you use to hold the racket. It seems that the majority of players hold the racket in their palm, and then wrap their fingers around the handle as an after thought (I used to do this too). When I was being coached by the Chinese coaches in Denmark they advocated a completely different approach, hold the bat with your fingers. In particular, pinch the bat between your thumb and index finger, then place the rest of your hand around the racket.\nThis was revolutionary for me!\nIf you haven’t done this before, have a go. I will be writing more about this in the future and definitely doing some videos on it as I think it is a really important technical tip that isn’t very widely known or understood. It also takes a fair bit of practice to master this new ‘feeling’ but it is completely worth it.\n2. Stance\nI wrote\na blog post about stance\na while back but I really want to improve it now. Your stance is hugely important as everything comes from it. Most obviously, a good stance makes it much easier to move. The majority of movement in table tennis is lateral (from side to side) and therefore we need a stance that makes quick lateral movements possible. Your stance will also effect your strokes and a poor stance can lead to technical errors in your shots.\nI didn’t fully understand the importance of stance until about halfway through the\nExpert in a Year challenge\nwith Sam. If you watch the first video, from our first day of training (1st January 2014) you’ll see that I only very briefly cover stance, before quickly moving on to grip and how to play a forehand drive. I think this is a common coaching mistake. We are in a rush to get our players ‘hitting balls’ and don’t spend the time we should on stance, and later, footwork.\nIf I were to coach a beginner from scratch again I would spend the whole first session just looking at stance. I would make sure they understand every aspect of it and why it is important. I would get them to shift their weight from one foot to the other, to understand weight transfer. I would get them to try out different stances, narrow feet, wide feet, standing upright, leaning forwards. I would make sure they are relaxed in this stance (this is really important) as we have a tendency to tense up when we are trying to put out body in an unnatural position.\nIt’s difficult to ‘coach’ stance via the internet. You really need to be there in front of a player to work out all the subtle errors. I think what I will try to do at some point is take a complete beginner and spend half an hour teaching them the correct stance until they fully understand it. I’ll film the session so I can upload it to YouTube and then it should be easier to self-diagnose your own problems.\n3. Footwork\nNow that you’ve mastered the correct grip and stance you are probably pretty keen to start actually playing some table tennis, but hold your horses. I think you’ll do much better in the long run if you first master the basic footwork and movement patterns/steps. These are easiest to learn away from the table, for example in a gym. It’s even better if you can do them in front of a mirrored wall (I’ve become a huge fan of mirrored walls for technique work since using them for the\nExpert in a Year\nchallenge).\nYou should start by practicing your side-stepping. You can do this is a big circle, round and round. All you are trying to do is find a rhythm and stay in your table tennis stance. This is harder than it sounds because the automatic reaction is to stand upright, when side-stepping, and dart around like a footballer. This is no good. You need to get used to sidestepping in with your knees bent, body crouched and leaning forwards, and arms out in front of you. You need to stay on the balls of your feet and keep your head low and at a constant height throughout, not bobbing up and down. Believe me, it isn’t as easy as it sounds and it doesn’t feel very natural. It’s much more work on your legs than side-stepping like a footballer would.\nOnce you can do that it’s time to think about the kinds of movements you’ll be doing at the table. You wont need to side-step round and round, instead you’ll probably never do more than two steps to the right, or two steps to the left. The key is changing directions quickly and keeping your balance throughout. You should practice some sidesteps in a few different routines; one right – one left, two right – two left, and so forth. Focus on balance and quickness.\nThere are also a few other footwork steps you can learn. For example, the one step, where you stand in your ready position and then simply lunge one leg to the side to reach the imaginary ball, play the shot, and then return back to your ready position. If there is no time for a side step this is a good option. There is also the ‘bunny hop’ as Sam and I were calling it. In this step you are constantly on the move, shifting your weight from one foot to the other without any stops in between.\nAgain, all this stuff is hard to describe but I’ll make some videos to upload to YouTube, once we are finished with the Expert in a Year challenge and I have a bit more time on my hands, that go through everything in detail.\n4. Strokes\nThe final step is to actually learn your strokes. If you have already mastered stance, grip and footwork you should be in a really good place to learn proper strokes. I think you will also learn faster than a player that doesn’t have any understanding of the first three steps.\nI have written posts on some of the basic strokes and I’ll put links to them below. As with many of my other posts, I think I’ll want to rewrite them since my trip to Denmark and my experiences during the Expert in a Year challenge. I’ve learnt so much about how to coach that I think I could do a much better job now than before. For now though, until I find the time to rewrite everything, here are those posts.\nHow to play a…\nForehand drive\n–\nBackhand drive\n–\nBackhand push\n–\nForehand push\nI’m really keen to make some videos for these too and you can expect them to be ready by early 2015.\nSummary\nTechnique is really important, especially if you are a beginner, but it isn’t the only important thing. Don’t become a “technique freak” as Istvan Moldovan liked to say. Don’t have improving your technique, or making your shots feel better, as your number one goal. Improving your technique should be a means to an end, which is improving your overall development as a player, and specifically your match performance.\nA strong technique will help you play table tennis more efficiently, making the best use of what you’ve got, and decreasing the chance of injury.\nWhen you tackle technique I believe you should do so in the following order; stance, grip, footwork, strokes.\nI hope this look at technical training for table tennis has been useful for you and do let me know how you get on applying these principles to your own game!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJune 22, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Play a Forehand Loop in Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Play a Forehand Loop in Table Tennis\nThe forehand loop is probably the most important advanced table tennis stroke you will ever learn. In the modern game the majority of attacking shots are loops and the forehand loop is particularly dominant. It is therefore an important weapon at all levels of play from intermediate to world-class.\nThe forehand loop is built on top of the\nforehand drive\n, adding additional speed, spin and power to the basic forehand. You should have mastered\nthe four basic strokes\nand developed a technically correct\nforehand drive\nbefore beginning to learn the forehand loop. This will make the learning process smoother and aid your long-term development and progression as a table tennis player.\nIn this post I will give you all the information you need in order to master the forehand loop.\nStance & Positioning\nYour stance should be similar to that of a forehand drive.\nYour feet should be at least 1.5 shoulder widths apart (some players are closer to 2 shoulder widths).\nYour right foot should be slightly further back than your left.\nYour knees should be a little bent.\nYour weight should be leaning forwards on the front parts of your feet.\nYour upper body should be relaxed.\nThe muscles in your legs should be activated, providing your with a solid base and enabling you to move and adjust your position if you need to. Your center of gravity should be low with your upper body being crouched or slightly hunched. Allow your shoulders to drop and relax. This contrast between the upper body and the lower body is key in my opinion.\nWhen it comes to getting into the right position it can be useful to think of a triangle.\nMake a triangle between your shoulders and your hands by reaching out in front of you, with both arms, and putting your hands together. Then twist slightly so that your hands and pretty much in line with your right foot. Assuming you are right-handed this is the perfect positioning for your forehand loop.\nWhen you play your forehand loop you will need to adjust your feet so that the ball comes into that point of your triangle. It’s important to get your right foot in line with the ball. This will prevent you from reaching (because the ball is too far away) or getting cramped (because the ball is too close to your body).\nMotion\nThe motion of the forehand loop is like an exaggerated forehand drive.\nYou need to get a little lower (you can play a forehand drive pretty much standing up straight but in order to loop well you need to get your body, arm and bat a bit lower in preparation).\nYou need to use a little more weight transfer (transfer your weight onto your right foot during the backswing and then onto your left root as you make contact with the ball, assuming you are right-handed).\nYou need to use a little more rotation (rotate from your waist, not you shoulders).\nYou need to use a bit more elbow (the elbow stays largely fixed during a forehand drive but for a loop your shoulder extend the elbow during the backswing and then flex the elbow as you make contact with the ball).\nYou need to close your bat angle a little more (a drive is played with roughly a 45 degree bat angle whereas a forehand loop should go slightly more over the top of the ball, assuming you are playing against a topspin ball).\nYou need to accelerate faster (a drive is a controlled shot and doesn’t require much acceleration but the forehand loop is a more aggressive shot and needs more speed, snap, zip, or whatever you want to call it, with your body and arm).\nYou need to brush the ball more (a drive doesn’t involve too much spin whereas a loop should probably have more spin than speed, so make sure you are brushing and not hitting the ball).\nThat is quite a lot to take in. Perhaps it will be easier to understand with a video. Here is Ma Long playing some forehand loops in slow motion.\nYou can clearly see him getting low, using his legs and waist for rotation and power, and closing his bat angle so that he can accelerate over the top of the ball and brush it with lots of spin. His upper body will also be fairly relaxed during this which allows him to react to the variations in the ball quickly. Staying relaxed is very important.\nFinish and Recovery\nAfter you have made contact with the ball you should do a little something like this…\nYour forehand loop swing should finish with your hips pretty much square to the table and your bat roughly in front of your face.\nYou shouldn’t let your bat go too far across your body or allow it to swing you around. On the flip side, if your arm and bat are finishing still on the right side of your body (instead of central) then your swing is probably too short or you aren’t rotating enough.\nIf you watch the Ma Long video you should also notice that his backswing/recovery motion is slightly different to his forward motion. He doesn’t go back along the same path. Instead, the arm and bat recover and move backwards more in line with the stomach, whereas they move forward during the forehand loop motion more in line with the chest.\nThis is important and will keep your bat always moving instead of having a stop-start phase at final point of the backswing and finish position.\nThe Perfect Forehand Loop\nI am hoping to get Brian Pace on\nThe Expert Table Tennis Podcast\nsoon to chat to him about the perfect forehand loop (if you are reading this in the future that episode will almost certainly be recorded and you can find it on iTunes on by searching ETT).\nAbout a year ago he uploaded a forehand loop training video to YouTube under that name and it has since clocked up over 400,000 views and 1,000 thumbs up! Brian is well known for his big forehand loop.\nThere are loads of other tips and pieces of advice that you can use to improve your forehand loop. As I said at a beginning of this article the forehand loop is one of the biggest weapons used by even world-class players and they have spent years perfecting their technique and style. The forehand loop is not simple something you can learn and then be done with. You should always be looking for ways to improve your loop, adding more speed or spin or even variation to your strokes.\nThis article is just the beginning but I hope you now have the confidence to be able to go and give the forehand loop a try. If anything is unclear, or you would like further information, please leave a comment and I’m sure either I or another reader will be able to help you."

    "title": "How to Play a Backhand Loop in Table Tennis",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJuly 13, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Play a Backhand Loop in Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Play a Backhand Loop in Table Tennis\nA few weeks ago I wrote a post on\nhow to play a forehand loop\n, arguably the most important stroke in table tennis. Today I’m going to be looking at the technique of the backhand loop, perhaps the second most important stroke.\nOver recent years, the backhand loop has become more and more prominent at the highest levels. Gone are the days when players only loop with their forehand and block/flat hit with their backhand. Penholders have developed the reverse penhold backhand, two-wing loopers are everywhere, and elite player are even receiving short serves to their forehand side with a backhand flick (who would have seen that coming twenty years ago).\nThe backhand loop is an advanced topspin stroke that is built upon the\nbackhand drive\n. You should be able to play a good backhand drive before attempting to master the backhand loop.\nThis post will go through all the technical aspects of how to play a backhand loop in table tennis. I’ll also give you some coaching tips and training ideas to help you practice and progress with your improvement. As with all aspects of table tennis, learning the backhand loop isn’t easy and will require a serious investment of time. However, once you’ve mastered the action it should be like riding a bike, and you’ll never forget the flowing wrist movement and timing ever again.\nStance & Positioning\nYour stance should be similar to that of a backhand drive.\nYour feet should be at least 1.5 shoulder widths apart (some players are closer to 2 shoulder widths).\nYour feet should be “square to the line of play”, which mean facing where you are going to hit the ball.\nYour knees should be a little bent.\nYour weight should be leaning forwards on the front parts of your feet.\nYour upper body should be relaxed.\nThe muscles in your legs should be activated, providing your with a solid base and enabling you to move and adjust your position if you need to. Your center of gravity should be low with your upper body being crouched or slightly hunched. Allow your shoulders to drop and relax. This contrast between the upper body and the lower body is key in my opinion.\nIn terms of your positioning, if you are right-handed you want to get your left hip behind the ball. It is more natural to play a backhand loop towards the left side of your torso.\nYou also want to get relatively close to the ball so that you don’t need to reach too far forwards (this will make it more difficult to get power from your arm and body, and also cause you to lose some control), or have to let the ball drop too much before getting to you (standing too far back is the main reason why some players take the ball too late).\nMotion & Recovery\nThe easiest way to describe the backhand loop technique is to imagine yourself throwing a frisbee. That means it requires a lot of wrist flick, a bit of extension from the elbow, and some rotation of the shoulder.\nIt is really difficult to explain the movement correctly with words alone, so at this point I’m going to hand over to Brett Clarke of ttEDGE and his fantastic backhand loop tutorial video.\nI particularly like the common mistakes section and demonstrations as these make it really easy to self-diagnose problems you may be having. Thanks, Brett!\nWhere I disagree with Brett\nBrett’s final common mistake was, “14. Going in circles”. In the video, he goes on to use a massive circular motion to exaggerate the movement, with his bat and arm ending up way over to the other side of his body for the follow through and finish. This is clearly an iffy way to play.\nHowever, I do like to coach my players to use circular motions on their forehand and backhand topspin strokes, where it appears Brett goes for the one dimensional back and forward technique where the swing moves in both directions along the same line.\nI believe if you look at top players playing their loops you will notice that they make a narrow circle with their swing. Below is a slow-motion video of Ma Long’s backhand loop and you can clearly see that the forward part of the swing happens to the left side of his body while the backswing and prep occur on the right side. He\nis\nmaking a small circle and I prefer this swing to the straight back and forward one demonstrated by Brett as I believe it allows for constant movement which makes the swing smoother and less ‘stop-start’.\nI was taught this circular backhand technique by Lei Yang (technical coach of the German National Team) while I was training in Denmark last summer and it went a long way to improving my backhand loop and open-up. I just felt so much nicer to have the arm and bat moving constantly and a recovery/backswing on the right hip (instead of the left) makes it much easier to switch between backhand and forehand strokes than going back along the same line as the forward swing.\nThat’s my opinion anyway!\nHow to practice your backhand loop\nWhen you are learning the backhand loop it can be great to start off with multiball or playing against a robot. This will give you a chance to relax, not worry about making mistakes, and focus on the swing.\nOnce you are getting the hang of it you will need to find a practice partner who can block your loops. Practicing in a rally situation will help you to learn how to adjust to the ball coming to slightly different positions. It also a great opportunity to start working on the own consistency and accuracy. Ideally you should be able to play about twenty backhand loops in a row without a mistake.\nThen it’s time to make things a little more complicated. Perhaps start with an exercise such as one backhand loop, one forehand loop. This is an opportunity to practice the shot outside of isolation. You can also trying using your backhand loop in a few more regular and irregular drills. Another option is to ask someone to serve long to your backhand so that you can practice backhand looping their serves. You should think about looping to different positions too.\nBasically, there are loads of things you can try out to make it more difficult. Remember that learning is a long process and just because your backhand loop looks good against the robot doesn’t mean that you have mastered the backhand loop. You should want to ‘overlearn’ the shot. By that I mean do so much of it that it is close to perfect in every possible situation.\nCrank up the power\nOnce you have a decent backhand loop you might like to try out the following tip to add more power to your stroke…\nStart rotating your waist into the shot.\nElite level player may even stand with their right foot slightly forwards when playing a big backhand loop to give themselves a little more space to swing on their left side and also to rotate their waist into the shot as they make contact.\nI wrote a blog post about this (with another Ma Long video) back in 2013 which you might like to check out\nhere\n.\nOther technical articles\nSo, that’s everything you need to know to start learning how to play a backhand loop in table tennis. For more technique tips check out the following articles…\nHow to Play Table Tennis in 10 Days\nThe Four Basic Strokes of Table Tennis\nHow to Play a Forehand Loop\nI hope this post has helped you.

    "title": "Improve Your Forehand Loop by Relaxing the Wrist",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJune 29, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nImprove Your Forehand Loop by Relaxing the Wrist\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nImprove Your Forehand Loop by Relaxing the Wrist\nLast week I looked at the basics of\nhow to play a forehand loop\n. After finishing the post I remembered something that Lei Yang (an ex-Chinese national team player and current technical coach of the German national team) had shown me during one of our multiball sessions in Denmark last summer that had had a huge effect on improving my forehand loop.\nI decided, instead of bolting it onto the end of that post, to give it it’s own article. It is a technical tip that could spark some debate, as I know that certain coaches and players differ in their views, but I believe in it. It was also featured in\na recent discussion on MyTableTennis.net\nabout how to make your forehand loop more powerful.\nWARNING: This is another blog post that is big on the anatomy of the wrist and forearm. I seem to be obsessed with this kind of thing at the moment after writing all about\nsupination and pronation of the forearm\na couple of weeks ago.\nExcluding supination and pronation (which predominantly come from the forearm) the wrist can move in two different ways;\nFlexion and extension\nUlnar and radial deviation\nFlexion & Extension\nFlexion describes the movement of dropping the hand, or bending the palm down towards the wrist. Extension describes the movement of lifting the hand, or raising the back of the hand. The image below explains all…\nPosition your wrist in a flexed position and you are able to hook the ball with your forehand loop. This adds sidespin to your loop and helps you to curve the ball wide to your opponents forehand side.\nPosition your wrist in an extended position and you are able to fade the ball with your forehand loop. For many years this was my signature shot. It adds the other type of sidespin to your loop and enables you to hit winners down the line.\nHooking and fading is one way to use your wrist to change your forehand loop, and it is great for variation, but while the wrist does move away from a neutral position, it remains fixed in place during the stroke. You are using the wrist to alter the angle you can get on the ball, not to improve the quality of your shot with extra speed and spin.\nOn the backhand you\ncan\nuse flexion and extension to add speed and spin. You will see the majority of players flex their wrist during the backswing and extend it during contact with the ball.\nIt’s the frisbee motion coaches often talk about and it works great on the backhand but doesn’t make sense on the forehand. This is because technically our forehand and backhand loops are fundamentally different.\nTo explain that I need a video…\nThat kind of wrist movement just doesn’t work on a forehand loop. We need a different kind of wrist movement.\nUlnar & Radial Deviation\nUlnar deviation describes the movement of bending the wrist to the little finger. The ulna bone goes along that side of your forearm. Radial deviation describes the movement of bending the wrist o the thumb. The radius bone goes along that side of your forearm. Ulnar deviation is usually greater than radial deviation.\nIn a neutral position the wrist would be straight and in line with the forearm. However, when playing table tennis the wrist would usually stay in an ulnar flexed position throughout the rally (as we want our bat, instead of our hand, to be in line with our forearm). Our ready position, often referred to as being “neutral”, is neutral in a flexion and extension sense but not in a ulnar and radial deviation sense.\nAnyway, back to Denmark…\nI was doing forehand loops with Lei Yang on a multiball table and he came round and started moving my wrist in this plane of motion, from ulnar flexion to radial flexion. He wanted me to use my wrist on my forehand loop.\nI have never done this before. My wrist always stayed locked and tense during my loop, so this was completely new.\nI started trying to force it through as I played the shot and it felt very very weird. I didn’t like. It felt really unnatural. But I stuck with it.\nIt didn’t really get much better and Lei Yang’s English wasn’t the best so I struggled through not really sure why it felt so wrong. It wasn’t until a couple of days later that I realised.\nI injured my back during the camp (Lei Yang said it was because I was too tense when I play) and after a couple of days rest I came back with a super relaxed style, terrified of getting injured again.\nSuddenly it all clicked.\nOnce I relaxed the muscles in my shoulder and arm the wrist movement Lei Yang had been so insistent about started all on it’s own. I realised that for all these years I had been stopping my wrist from moving by holding it in place with certain arm muscles and that, by relaxing, I had freed it. My wrist (and bat) were now swinging about unhindered.\nThis made a huge difference to the amount of acceleration I could get on my forehand loop and massively increased my spin.\nWant to see this technique in action?\nHere’s an old video of Ma Long training multiball where you can see his wrist and bat flying around because his arm muscles are clearly all relaxed.\nI believe this is another piece of advice that could have an immediate effect on your game.\nLook around at a group of players and you should be able to start to see the difference between those that use their wrist in their forehand loop (because they have relaxed it) and those that don’t (because their muscles are holding it fixed in position). There is a big difference and the wristy loops are much better, in my opinion.\nYou don’t need to try and force your wrist through the range of motion (like I did at first with Lei Yang). All you need to do is relax, time your backswing correctly and let it happen on it’s own. You will end up with the desired whip-like effect, and a lot more speed and spin on your forehand loop.\nDo you agree with me?\nI’ve spent quite a lot of time thinking about this concept and I’m happy now with my conclusions.\nDo you agree? Is there anything I’ve missed?\nIf so, leave a comment and let me know. Thanks for reading the article and if there is any topic you would like me to write about let me know and I’ll do my best to make it happen."

    "title": "Using Your Waist on the Backhand Loop",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nNovember 27, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nUsing Your Waist on the Backhand Loop\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nUsing Your Waist on the Backhand Loop\nI was watching a few table tennis videos on YouTube yesterday and stumbled across this old video of Ma Long practicing his backhand loop with multiball, fed by Liu Guoliang.\nI’ve seen this video before but it was only this time that Liu Guoliang’s main coaching point really stood out. He demonstrates the problem and solution about 17 seconds in, and it’s all about Ma Long’s use of the waist!\nHe is telling Ma Long that his current rotation is not enough and also that it is bringing his body up instead of forwards. He then exaggerates the actual waist rotation he wants to see. The action Liu Guoliang demonstrates is very similar to the forehand loop (with lots of weight transfer and rotation from the hips).\nThis post will look at that technique in detail and how we can better use our waist during the backhand loop.\nTraditional European coaching\nTraditionally the technique for the forehand and backhand loop has been quite different. I think this goes all the way back to our coaching of the forehand and backhand drive. When we learn to play a forehand drive elements such as weight transfer and waist rotation are key coaching points. For the backhand drive they are not included.\nAs far as I can tell this is the same in China. A drive is just a drive and a backhand drive doesn’t require any rotation of the waist.\nThe problem comes when this technique is translated into the forehand and backhand loop. The lack of significant weight transfer and waist rotation during the backhand loop makes the shot considerably weaker than the forehand loop.\nFor decades we’ve seen this problem at the elite level. Players had blinding forehands but their backhands couldn’t generate the same level of power. Some top Chinese players got away with barely playing a backhand at all and just moving at lightning speeds to cover the table with their forehand.\nRecently, we’ve seen the backhand becoming as much of a weapon as the forehand and I believe this is largely due to the kind of coaching we can see in this video. Liu Guoliang is clearly now transferring the principles of the forehand loop over to the backhand side and emphasising weight transfer and body rotation in order to increase power.\nI know that some European coaches and players will say that this is nothing new and that they already know the importance of the waist in the backhand loop. I think the problem is that we often only pay lip service to the idea and we still don’t see anything inherently wrong with a backhand loop that is played almost all from the arm.\nThe backhand open-up\nBear in mind that in this video Ma Long is playing his backhand loop against a backspin feed! This is a backhand open-up shot rather than just a loop against a block.\nThe technique where a player bends their knees, drops down, lowers their wrist and then brushes up the back of the ball will surely be obliterated by this modern backhand open-up. Current equipment (and technique) means that this old-school style of “looping” is no longer necessary.\nI, for one, still teach the backhand loop to be taken in front of the body, slightly to the left side or in front of the right hip. While it still might be worth coaching this shot to our players, or learning it ourselves if you are a player, I think we must now see it as a stepping stone between the backhand drive and this new modern backhand loop.\nJust watch the video again…\nSurely this is the future of the backhand loop in top-level table tennis!\nIs this more natural anyway?\nI usually find that when coaching this backhand drive to beginners they naturally try and play the stroke from the side of their body. Despite the fact that they don’t yet have the control of the ball to be able to do this it would seem that it just feels more natural.\nPerhaps this is from playing other racket sports. After all, when have you ever seen a tennis player play a powerful backhand ground stroke from in front on their left hip? No. They turn their body, transfer their weight and strike the ball out to the side of themselves.\nMaybe we could even start teaching players to use some rotation on the backhand drive, to get them used to the movement early on. I guess that’s for another post all together.\nThe way forward\nIf you are a player looking to compete at a relatively high level I suggest that you start looking to develop your backhand loop into more of a power weapon by incorporating weight transfer and rotation into your stroke. I’m not saying this is going to be easy. You’ve probably played thousands of strokes with your current technique, and any change is going to take time, but surely it’s worth it.\nIf you are a coach then I think we seriously need to start thinking of ways to implement this new backhand technique into our coaching. Multiball or robot practice is probably the best way to do it but I believe that our younger players need to be taught this from early on and our older players need to start working at trying it out and making changes to their current technique.\nJust imagine a good player playing a forehand topspin without rotation or weight transfer. We’d say it was a lazy shot if it came primarily from the arm. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same is said of a backhand loop in the next few years.\nSo those are my thoughts and I’d love to hear yours.

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nDecember 15, 2012\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Serve Like Kenta Matsudaira\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Serve Like Kenta Matsudaira\nKenta Matsudaira (aged just 21 and currently ranked 39th in the world) has a very effective tomahawk serve. If you’ve ever watched him play you will have seen him confuse opponents with his ability to serve it forehand or backhand, long or short, and side/top or side/chop. This level of variation, and the fact that it is quite an unfamiliar serve, makes it deadly to return.\nIn this post we’ll be having a look a Kenta’s serve in the hope that we have come up with some tips to help us replicate it ourselves. I’ve spent a little bit of time practicing the serve and had quite a lot of fun doing it. I’ve also used in a couple of times in competitive matches and despite my current lack of skill the ‘surprise factor’ alone has won me a few points off of it.\nIf you have no idea what I’m talking about then the video below will clear things up. Here Kenta serves his famous backhand tomahawk serve, with topspin, to Ma Lin.\nSo what is it that makes Kenta’s tomahawk serve so effective?\nUnfamiliarity\n– Most players serve from their backhand corner. Kenta’s serve comes from the middle of the table. Most players serve with their forehand. Kenta uses his backhand frequently. Most serves have a contact point close to the servers chest. Kenta’s makes contact with the ball close to his ear. All of these factors add up to make the serve quite peculiar.\nVariation\n– As I have mentioned earlier Kenta’s ability to vary his serve is what makes it such a weapon. If he always served with the backhand, it was always short and always side/backspin the serve would be nowhere near as effective. The huge amount of possible variation increases the amount of thinking the receiver has to do before selecting a shot.\nDeception\n– Variation is not much use if the serve is easy to read but Kenta manages to make even the forehand and backhand serve look identical before the point of contact. You’ll see this in more detail in a slow-motion video I’ve posted below.\nHeavy spin\n– Finally the huge amount of spin Kenta manages to place on the ball makes it curve massively and really kick off the opponents racket. It makes the receiver have to commit fully to a shot as they know anything less will let the spin of the ball have it’s own way.\nHow to Serve Like Kenta\nHere’s a slow motion video of Kenta serving tomahawk and reverse tomahawk. If you watch closely you can see the difference between the two serves with forehand or backhand.\nFrom the video I have picked out the following coaching tips.\nStand middle and square\n– Should go without saying really but worth pointing out as we don’t stand like this for many serves. Feet should be pretty much square to the table.\nGet low\n– Kenta makes contact with the ball just above the ear. In order keep the serve low and not bouncy you’ll need to get your head just above table level.\nBend your wrist\n– Just before contact with the ball Kenta’s wrist bends backwards. This allows him to snap it forwards generating lots of spin.\nStop the bat\n– When I was practicing this serve I would let the bat finish about a foot in front of me but from watching Kenta you see that his bat stops almost immediately after making contact with the ball, not too far from his head.\nI found this tutorial on YouTube. It’s not the best but it gives you an idea and a chance to see someone else having a go at the serve.\nThe guy in the video seems to be using a lot more arm than Kenta, which probably means he isn’t using his wrist quite enough.\nAlois Rosario from PingSkills made a great point when asked about this serve. He said…\nDo it a lot of times without the ball.  When you start to practice the serve with the ball only focus on the movement of the bat.  Forget anything else including hitting the ball.  If you miss the ball a lot of times that is fine.  Eventually you will start to get the two things to happen together, swinging correctly and hitting the ball correctly.\nAnd on that note I think we’ll leave it there. It’s definitely worth spending a bit of time trying out Kenta’s serve. Even if you don’t end up using it in your matches it will give you an increased understanding of generating spin on your serve.\nThanks for reading and keep practicing!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMarch 10, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTactical Training for Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTactical Training for Table Tennis\nTactics are an often neglected area of table tennis training. It’s easy to get stuck in the\ntechnical training\n, become obsessed with perfecting your technique, and forget all about how you are going to use your technically brilliant strokes to actually win matches.\nIf you’re the kind of player who feels like you should be performing at a higher level than you are, then there’s a good chance that it’s your tactical game that is holding you back.\nMy experience (or lack of experience) with tactical training\nFor much of my table tennis career I fell into this category. I’d been playing the sport for a number of years, the majority of my strokes were well developed, accurate and consistent, I was fairly fit and agile compared to most of my opponents, I was very good in practice and could practice with some of the best players in the country for my age group.\nIt all sounded like a recipe for success, but something was holding me back. My results at tournaments were never as good as I hoped they would be. I kept going to different tournaments, most weekends, thinking next time will be my break-through where I finally perform as well as I know I can. The problem was… it didn’t happen.\nThe guys I was training with were just as confused. They’d see my draw, and my seeding as one of the top players in the band, and say, “You should win that group, those guys aren’t very strong.” Then we’d all go our separate ways to play our groups and bump into each other again a couple of hours later. And how did it go? They’d get through their groups as winner or runner-up, in higher bands than me, playing better opponents. I would have had “another nightmare”, or something similar, and gone out on count-back after losing a match to a player I should never lose to, and failing to beat the only half-decent player in my group. It would happen over-and-over and I didn’t know why.\nEventually, after giving it plenty of thought and speaking with a number of coaches, I figured it out. My practice was all about technical training. I would do technique-based, regular drills with my higher-level training partners and look like I was as good a player as them. When we were both doing ‘backhand, middle, backhand, wide’ you’d never guess that I was ranked 70th in the juniors and my partner was ranked 20th. We looked the same. And my training partner was happy to practice with me because I always gave him a good practice.\nThe problem was, I’d become a table tennis practice robot. I’d become too used to putting the ball in exactly the right place for my opponent’s drill. I had a push that had enough backspin to make it nice to open up but not so much that it was difficult. I’d got into the habit of hitting everything cross-court, diagonally. My serves in matches were just like I was doing a serve and return drill. I’d serve short, pure backspin, to the middle of the table, every single time.\nHow to train your tactics\nI hope that you now have an understanding of why being good tactically is so important as a table tennis player. Players that look good knocking up but under-perform are probably technically strong but tactically weak. Players that don’t look so good knocking up but always seem to get the results in their matches are probably tactically strong but technically weak. I’m sure you can think of players that fit both of those descriptions.\nThe essence of tactical table tennis is switching the focus from yourself to your opponent. You need to be able to work out your opponents strengths and weaknesses, and then come up with some ideas of ‘plays’ they may struggle against. These ‘plays’ can be general or specific. If you’re interesting learning more about how to incorporate these ‘plays’ or set-pieces into your table tennis then check out my FREE eBook,\nThe Table Tennis Playbook\n.\nGeneral tactics are tools you can use against any opponent you come up against. They are based around the general weakness that all players have and therefore, if used correctly, should be effective against most players. Specific tactics are more difficult to develop as they involve actually analyzing your opponent and working out the particular things they struggle with. I will now go into more detail on both types of tactical training.\nGeneral tactical training\nThere are some tactics that work well against pretty much all players you are going to come across. These include things like…\nPlaying into their crossover point (playing elbow)\nUsing wide angles\nGiving them deep heavy backspin digs\nKeep everything tight and short so they cannot attack\nAlways trying to attack (get in) first\nVarying your serves\nKeeping the ball away from their strongest side (usually forehand)\nAdding float balls as a variation\nPlaying short to their forehand corner and then deep to their backhand corner (or vice versa)\nStaying very close to the table\nAdding sidespin to your shots (hooks, fades, sidespin pushes etc.)\nIf you’ve ever had a corner coach that isn’t actually paying much attention to your game you may well have heard them reel off several of these in the 60 seconds you get to spend together. They may say something like, “You’re playing great! Just make sure you stay up to the table, keep the ball short, and try to get in first if you can. And when you do attack, attack into their crossover point.”\nIt’s not that any of that stuff is wrong. It’s just that you could have your eyes shut for the whole game and then enthusiastically give that kind of advice to your player. These are general tactics. General tactics, however, are great for tactical training because it’s easy to practice them in drills against your regular training partners. Here are a few ideas of drills you could come up with to work on these general tactics. I wont cover everything, just a few ideas. Use your imagination to come up with more.\nDo a regular or irregular drill but play everything into your partners crossover point. This will be slightly annoying for them but it’s your drill and it can be difficult to find the crossover point of your opponent in a match if you have trained yourself in practice to always attack into the forehand or backhand.\nPut a table tennis barrier behind you, about two metres from your end of the table, and do your drills or matches in that area. This way you don’t even give yourself the option of dropping back or falling away. This used to be a big tactical problem for me which made my shots weaker and gave my opponent more time.\nWhen doing a service drill, chuck in a long fast serve 10-20% of the time. This will get you used to varying your serves, help you practice deception/disguising your serve, and get you used to the typical return from your fast serve when your opponent isn’t expecting it.\nVary your return of serve when your training partner is doing a service drill. I used to just give them the same perfect push over-and-over again. This will make them feel like they are playing well in the short-term but it’s no good for either of you in the long run. Instead, if they want you to push long to their forehand, push some heavy and some more floaty, push some wider and some more into the middle, push some really deep and touch the occasional one short.\nPractice your favourite ‘plays’. How about this one; serve short to your opponents forehand, if they push then dig deep and wide into their backhand corner, if they flick then topspin deep and wide into their backhand corner. This kind of tactic, where you use the full length and width of the table, works against most players so practicing it in training is a very good idea.\nThis kind of training is more variable than technical training and you probably wont feel as good doing it. It lacks the rhythm and repetition of technical training. However, it is probably more likely to have a positive influence on your match performance, so ignore it at your own peril.\nSpecific tactical training\nImproving your ability to devise tactics to beat specific players is more about your mindset and knowledge than your practice drills. All playing styles have weaknesses and it’s your job, if you are serious about becoming a top player, to learn them. You can do this through books (such as [easyazon_link identifier=”1477643788″ locale=”US” tag=”exptabten-20″]Table Tennis Tactics for Thinkers[/easyazon_link] by Larry Hodges) or by match experience and taking notes about what worked against certain styles and what didn’t. I would advise doing both.\nI bet if you were to ask Ma Long, or one of the other top Chinese players, how to beat Timo Boll they would be able to tell you from memory. They would have video of him to watch, documents full of tactics that are known to work against him and his weaknesses, and coaches that they can discuss ideas with. That level of detail to specific/individual tactical training is one of the reasons they are the best in the world at table tennis. They spend a lot of time working out how best to beat certain types of players and even specific players that they encounter on a regular basis.\nIf we are serious about our table tennis then we need this level of commitment to our tactical training too. We should be spending time away from the table to analyze our past matches. To do this we need to be filming our competitive matches. This is something that I think is really important if we are to really learn from our matches and develop our tactics. If you look at the photo at the top of this page, from one of Timo Boll’s matches, you’ll notice his coach Jorg Rosskopf has a camera and rip set-up to record the match.\nSummary\nTactical training is often neglected and replaced by additional technical training. We must get the balance right between technique and tactics and understand which one is most important for us at our stage of development. If you are a beginner then maybe you should be focused on technical training. However, if you are competing in tournaments or a league then there is a good chance you’d benefit from extra tactical training.\nI haven’t written loads about tactical training in the past but I will be covering it in more detail in the future. Thank you for reading a good luck with your tactical development!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMarch 26, 2015\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nMental Training for Table Tennis\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nMental Training for Table Tennis\nThey say that at the highest level of sport it’s an athlete’s mental strength that is the difference between winning and losing. All the top table tennis players can play the best shots, and are in great physical condition, but who can play their best when it matters? Who has what it takes mentally to perform at the highest level and win when the pressure is on?\nI’m no expert on mental training in sport. I studied sports psychology as part of my Coaching and Sport Science degree but that’s about all the exposure I’ve had to it. If you are looking for an expert then Mark Simpson, a good friend of mine and creator of\nBrain-SPEC\n, is probably a better person to go. He has played table tennis at a semi-professional level in Europe and has just finished a two year Masters course in sports psychology.\nHowever, I’ll use this post to outline a number of areas, within sports psychology, that I know of and that you may be able to implement into your training. I’m hoping to team up with Mark at some point in the future and write a lot more about mental training for table tennis.\nFive sports psychology techniques\nSports psychologists use a number of different techniques when working with athletes. They could be trying to help an athlete overcome a particular problem or they may simply be aiming to help them improve their performance. There are five key techniques that you’ll come across again and again. In many ways they are quite simple to understand but putting them into practice can be tricky and requires practice.\n1. Arousal regulation\nWhen a sports psychologist talks about arousal they are basically referring to how pumped up you feel (physically and emotionally). Some players perform better when highly aroused (pumped up), while for others this can decrease their level of performance. Arousal is highly sport and individual dependent. Some sports you’ll want to be more pumped up for than others. Physical contact sports, for example, usually require a high level of arousal. You can use certain techniques to increase your arousal and get you ready to go out and perform.\nArousal regulation is also important for dealing with things like anxiety and nerves, a common problem for table tennis players. Sometimes you feel over-stressed, under pressure and a little scared. In these cases getting pumped up isn’t going to help, your heart is probably already racing. Instead you need some methods to decrease you heart rate and help you to relax. Methods such as progressive muscle relaxation and breathing exercises can help in these situations.\n2. Goal setting\nMost people have a fairly good understanding of goal setting and it’s use within sport and business. Sports psychologists will talk about SMART or SMARTER goals and importance of having different types of goals (short, medium and long term; process, performance and outcome goals). Short term goals can be used to help you to achieve long term goals and it kind of all goes hand in hand with planning your development and applying the principles of progression to your training plan.\n3. Imagery\nMark likes to talk a lot about imagery. I know that there is nothing funny or silly about it but for me it still has that kind of aura attacked to it. I’ve never really done any imagery so I can’t really imagine what it would be like to do it. I’m sure it works, research has proved that, I just don’t have any first-hand experience of it myself.\nImagery is all about creating or recreating an experience in your mind. It’s of way to practice, without even picking up a bat, and mentally rehearse you performance in a major tournament or match before you even arrive at the venue. In order for it to be successful it needs to be a life-like as possible and promote feelings of confidence in yourself. It can be especially effective when used the day before a big event to get yourself ready to perform.\n4. Pre-performance routines\nThis is all about your preparation for a match or tournament. It can involve imagery and visualization but it also includes things like routines, rituals, superstitions, self-talk, and warming up. A pre-performance routine can help to get your mind and body ready to perform. It works by creating triggers in your brain that associate performance, and ideally a good performance, with actions you can easily performance prior to the event.\nOne great idea that Mark had for Sam, during\nthe Expert in a Year challenge\n, was to create a video of him playing matches against people and playing really well. Mark said he should get into the habit of watching that video, accompanied by his favourite motivational song, before every practice session, and in time, every competitive match. Watching himself should help him to visualize a good performance and success and the routine of always watching the video should help get his body ready to perform once it has finished. I really like that idea and I’ve been working on creating that video for Sam so that he has it and can start practicing his routine a few weeks before he starts competing for real.\n5. Self-talk\nIt can be a whole intervention on it’s own! Being able to use positive self-talk is extremely important as a serious athlete. You aren’t going to achieve all your goals and play your best if you keep telling yourself you’re rubbish. Self-talk is all about the thoughts and words we use when we talk to ourself.\nOnce of the best ways to use self-talk is to come up with a positive phrase or words that you repeat to yourself over and over again. It’s like you are constantly telling yourself that you are good, that you can do this, that you are going to succeed. It’s up to you which word or phrase you choose but it could be something a simple of “fight”. Each time you say “fight” you know it means, keep working, you can do it, don’t quit. You can say it out loud or in your head.\nSummary\nThis is just a really brief overview of some of the popular sports psychology technique that you can use as a part of your mental training for table tennis. As I said at the start of the article, I’m no expert and I’m certainly not using many of these myself (although I should be). In particular, I really want to have a proper go at using imagery to improve my performance.\nI wish you luck with your progress psychologically as a table tennis player. Mental training is important!"

    "title": "How to Get “In The Zone” and Win – Like Tin-Tin Ho",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nApril 6, 2016\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Get “In The Zone” and Win – Like Tin-Tin Ho\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nHow to Get \"In The Zone\" and Win - Like Tin-Tin Ho\nYou may have heard other table tennis players talk about being “in the zone” during a match where they played particularly well. Perhaps you’ve even experienced it yourself. But what does it mean and how can we get into this often elusive “zone” more often?\nIn this blog post, I will share some of the current research on this topic and use Tin-Tin Ho’s performance in the final of the women’s singles event at the recent English National Championships as an example.\nWhat is “the zone”?\nThe zone is,\n“A peak state of mental functioning where you are entirely focused on the task at hand and, therefore, able to perform at your highest level.”\nThis sensation has been given many names, the other most common being “a state of flow” which was coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a Hungarian psychologist.\nWhen you are “in the zone” you are likely to experience a much greater awareness of what is going on. It can even feel like things are moving in slow-motion giving you ages to read the situation and respond correctly. All of this leads to far greater performance than usual.\nIn table tennis, this is often experienced as the feeling that you “can’t miss”. Every shot you play, no matter how aggressive/risky, is played perfectly. You give away no errors or mistakes.\nYou are most likely to enter the zone when you are being pushed to the limits of your ability. For example, when playing a complete beginner you could probably beat with your eyes closed, you aren’t going to be in the zone. The same is true if you find yourself up against Ma Long. If the result is basically decided before the match even begins, you aren’t going to end up in the zone.\nTin-Tin Ho vs Kelly Sibley\nI was reminded of the importance of being “in the zone” whilst watching the women’s final of this year’s English National Championships. The match was between #1 seed Kelly Sibley and #2 seed Tin-Tin Ho. Tin-Tin had never beaten Kelly before. She lost 4-2 to her in the final last year.\nI’ve known Tin-Tin since she was about 6 or 7 years old and I really wanted her to win. She lost the first set 11:5 – and I feared Kelly was simply too strong and experienced – but bounced back to take the second set 11:9.\nUnfortunately, the third set didn’t go her way at all and she lost 11:3. It was at this point that I started to worry that she was going to have to settle for second place. Perhaps she was too tired from all the matches she had played over the long weekend in the U21s, women’s and mixed doubles, and now the women’s singles.\nBut, in the fourth end, Tin-Tin came back to the table looking like a changed player. Her face was different. Her gaze had narrowed. When receiving serve she was practically frowning at Kelly. She looked strong. She looked “in the zone”.\n“She’s going to win this!” – I started calling out to Katie (my wife) who was in the other room.\nTin-Tin was still 2-1 down in games but I could see it in her eyes. She had decided this was her match – her title.\nDon’t get me wrong, it wasn’t easy. Tin-Tin won both the fourth and fifth sets 11:9 to give herself a 3-2 lead. But by the sixth game, you could see that all the momentum had swung over to Tin-Tin. She had a response for everything Kelly could throw at her, and her eyes stayed squarely fixed on either Kelly or the ball.\nShe won the sixth game 11:6. Her first win against Kelly and her first women’s singles national title – the first of many, I reckon!\nThe reason Tin-Tin is such a great example of being “in the zone” is that off-the-table she is such a relaxed and happy person. When\nI interviewed her for the podcast\nshe was laughing about how embarrassed she gets looking at pictures of herself playing where she looks so angry and serious!\nBut she couldn’t have won that match while maintaining a happy-go-lucky mindset and appearance. Watch a top performer playing their best in any sport and you’ll see that they all look the same – serious, focused, stern.\nHow to get “in the zone”\nI guess the big question now is what did Tin-Tin do to get “in the zone” during arguably the most important match of her career so far. She could have easily “choked”, underperformed, and let Kelly walk all over her. But she didn’t. She was able to play her best table tennis when it mattered most. How did she do it? I’ll let Tin-Tin explain…\nI find it’s best to use the situation to your advantage. The National Championships is the biggest domestic competition of the year so I tried to use that to motivate me to play the way I knew I was capable of.\nIt’s easy to let the circumstances effect your performance via nerves or negative pressure – I have experienced this too many times in the past few years. Therefore, I knew that if I entered the match with a negative mindset there would be no point even playing, as I would make lots of unforced errors for sure.\nI think the most important thing is to just focus on how to cause problems for your opponent. If I missed, I didn’t fight with myself. I just stayed positive. I asked myself, “How can I fight with the opponent if I’m fighting with myself?”\nThankfully, this helped me to find a way to start to play really positive table tennis. Naturally, when my mind is sharp I am able to play with more variation without having to think much about it.\nFrom speaking to Tin-Tin it would appear that, for her, two aspects were key…\nBefore the match\nBefore the match had even begun Tin-Tin had decided to use this potentially intimidating situation to her advantage. She found a way to approach the match with a positive attitude instead of a negative one. This is much easier to said than done, but it’s vitally important if you are to have any chance of getting “in the zone” and playing your best table tennis.\nTin-Tin used the pressure for motivation. She turned it into positive energy. This helped her to focus and enter “the zone”. She took control of the pressure and nerves of the situation by viewing it as potentially helpful to her performance. She could use it to play her best table tennis.\nThe alternative is the view the pressure as a negative. Something to be scared of. If you start worrying that you will be embarrassed if you lose in front of all these people and on live TV, you are allowing the pressure to become negative energy.\nSo, I believe that Tin-Tin did a lot of the work required to get “in the zone” prior to even stepping onto the court. It was all about her positive approach to the match. She viewed it as a challenge to be taken on rather than something scary and dangerous.\nDuring the match\nDuring the match, there are a number of different variables you can choose to focus on…\nYou can focus on the ball – this is what the majority of beginners do.\nYou can focus on yourself – this is the trap that a lot of competitive players fall into (including myself, at times).\nYou can focus on the conditions – this is when you find yourself moaning about the floor or the lighting.\nYou can focus on your opponent – this is the correct thing to focus on.\nI could tell during Tin-Tin’s match that she was focused on her opponent – Kelly Sibley. As she said, she wanted to “cause problems” for her. Tin-Tin wanted to beat Kelly and she turned her focus and concentration to this task. How to beat Kelly Sibley. She had never done it before.\nIt’s funny because you could assume that the best way to get “in the zone” is to focus on yourself. Maybe you need to psyche yourself up, or use some special breathing techniques, or go through some sort of routine/superstition. I’m not saying that stuff doesn’t work – and if you read other articles online about getting in the zone these are often mentioned – I just feel like us table tennis players can often become too internally focused.\nTin-Tin wasn’t particularly worried about how she felt. I doubt she was actively trying to get “in the zone”. Instead, she focused on something else and getting “in the zone” took care of itself.\nNow it’s your turn\nI hope that’s given you something to think about for your next league match or tournament.\nWhen you find yourself in a high-pressure situation, where you need to play your best when it matters most, remember to turn the stress/nerves into positive energy before the match. Use it as motivation to play your best. And then during the match focus on making life difficult for your opponent.\nIt’s your job to beat them, and that can be achieved by making them play bad as well as playing great yourself. At the table, you aren’t “friends” with the player on the other end. Your goal isn’t to have a “good” match. You should be trying to beat them. The best competitors understand this. They treat each match like a battle. If you don’t kill your opponent, your opponent is going to kill you!\nIn Tin-Tin’s words, focus on “causing problems for your opponent” and you’ll be most likely to get “in the zone” and win.\nIf you’ve enjoyed this article, please head on over to my\nTable Tennis Coaching\npage which contains an article of all of my coaching blog posts."

    "title": "2 Backhands, 2 Forehands",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMay 21, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n2 Backhands, 2 Forehands\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\n2 Backhands, 2 Forehands\nHello and welcome to the first lesson of Level 2 from my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\nseries.\nYou should now be able to play\n100 forehand drives\n,\n100 backhand drives\n,\n100 forehand pushes\nand\n100 backhand pushes\nwith correct technique and without a mistake. You should also have an understanding and application of the correct table tennis\ngrip\nand\nstance\n(that was all covered in level one).\nLevel 2 is all about regular movement drills. We’ll be combining the shots we learnt during level one with the side-step footwork to be able to cover the whole table.\nToday’s drill is a simple one;\ntwo backhands and two forehands\n.\nThe aim of this drill is to become comfortable moving side-to-side and switching between backhand and forehand drive. We will play two shots before moving so that we have move time to get ourselves into the correct position and are less likely to end up one step behind the ball.\nDemonstration\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find a video on YouTube showing this drill in particular. There are a few showing ‘one backhand, one forehand’ but that is drill #2. I think it is much easier to start with ‘two backhands, two forehands’ first. I will try to produce a video for this drill in the next couple of weeks and then I’ll add it to this page.\nI did find a useful graphic, produced by Greg Letts for About.com, so I have included that below.\nIn this illustration Player A is the controller and Player B is the one performing the drill. Player A is shown controlling the rally with the forehand but you could also control from your backhand. Personally, I find that beginners usually have a little more control with their backhand than their forehand and therefore the controller will often be playing all backhands. However, it is a good idea trying out both as the strokes for the mover will be slightly different as either the forehand or backhand drives goes down the line. Also, as the controller it is a good idea to become comfortable with your backhand and forehand and this is a good chance to practice.\nPlayer A would usually start with the ball (to make things easier).\nPlayer A would then play two forehand drives to Player B’s forehand.\nPlayer B would return them with two forehand drives to Play A’s forehand.\nThen, Play A would switch the direction and play two forehand drives to Player B’s backhand.\nPlayer B would side-step across to their backhand and return them with two backhand drives to Player A’s forehand.\nThen Player A would repeat the process from point 2, with two forehand drives to Player B’s forehand.\nIf you are controlling with your forehand you would normally start by playing the ball to your partner’s forehand. If you are using your backhand to control the first ball would usually go to your partner’s backhand. This means that the first two strokes they play are going diagonally, which is slightly easier and should help get them settled into the drill.\nVariations\nThere are a number of ways to tweak this exercise to focus on a different skill or stop it from becoming too repetitive.\nChange the controller from backhand to forehand (or even try controlling with the forehand from the middle line).\nChange the stroke and play forehand and backhand pushes instead of drives. You’ll need to get the controller to push as well.\nChange the number of shots on each wing. You could make it ‘3 backhands, 3 forehands’, or ‘2 backhands, 1 forehand’, it’s up to you.\nChanging the placement. How about playing into a backhand control and doing two backhand and then two forehands from the middle?\nThings to remember\nThe aim of this drill is to work on your movement.\nAvoid the temptation to stand in the middle of the table and reach for your backhand and forehand shots. Instead, focus on your footwork and the side-step. You should get into a rhythm of playing a moving. Also, make sure that you are not moving whilst playing a stroke (either because you are too keen to move and are moving before you’ve finished a stroke, or because you are moving too slow and still getting into position by the time the ball has reached you). You need to move first, then stop, and then play the strokes. At the top level sometimes they have to play strokes and move at the same time but for this drill, using drives or pushes, you should move first and then stop and make the stroke.\nYou are trying to make 50 shots in succession.\nDon’t play too hard or fast. At this level the aim is still accuracy and consistency. We want to keep the ball on the table, not spend all our practice session chasing after it. Slow the shots down and focus on playing 50 shots. That would be two backhands and two forehands counting as four in total, and so on. If you are the controller make sure the ball is going to the correct half of the table for your partner. If you are the mover then try and be as accurate as possible for the controller. This is especially important when you are playing the stroke down the line. Watch out that you are not ‘dragging’ your shots into the middle of the table.\nKeep a small amount of spin on the ball.\nWhether that’s topspin or backspin will depend on which shot you are playing but avoid the temptation to ‘prod’ or ‘poke’ at the ball as your concentration switches to your footwork. It’s very important that you maintain proper technique and keep some topspin on your drives. This will also make it easier for the controller to keep the rally going.\nThat should be all you need to know to start practice this first drill of\nHow to Play Table Tennis: Level 2\n. Next up is one backhand, one forehand, which is a little bit tougher but you should have a good foundation now that you can play 50 shots doing two backhands and two forehands.\nKeep practising and leave a comment if you need anything clarified or explained further, I’m sure I’ve forgotten at least one thing!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nMay 23, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nBackhand, Middle, Backhand, Wide\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nBackhand, Middle, Backhand, Wide\nDrill #3 in Level 2 of my\nHow to Play Table Tennis\nseries continues to use alternate backhand and forehand strokes but now incorporates a slightly more advanced movement pattern, with forehand being played both from the middle of the table and the wide forehand.\nI love this drill because it keeps you constantly moving and on your toes, allows you to naturally cover the whole table (as you would in a game) and teaches the importance of getting your forehand in on any balls to the middle of the table. Personally, I think this is a great warm-up drill for advanced players to use either at the beginning of a practice session or as a knock-up at a tournament.\nToday’s drill is the popular\nbackhand, middle, backhand, wide\n.\nThe aim of the drill is to continue developing your side-step quick movement, making large and small adjustments with your feet to ensure you are in the correct position to play your shots, and to develop your ability to quickly switch between backhand and forehand strokes keeping the quality of your technique.\nDemonstration\nOnce again, I couldn’t find a video on YouTube for this drill (I am definitely going to start making some) so I have knocked up an image showing the positioning of the four balls in the exercise.\nAssuming the control is using their backhand;\nYou play a backhand drive across the table into your partners backhand.\nYou adjust your feet slightly so that they are slightly more side-on and so that you can play comfortable forehand drive from the center line. This forehand is played into your partners backhand.\nYou return to your backhand side and play a backhand drive across the table.\nYou make a large side-step across to your wide forehand and adjust your feet so that they are more side-on to allow you to play a forehand drive down the line into your partners forehand.\nYou return to the backhand and repeat.\nVariations\nIt is a bit more difficult to make simply variations to this drill but there are still a few things you can try;\nChange the target and have the controller play forehands from the forehand side or the middle line.\nChange the stroke a play pushes instead of drives.\nI think it is good to keep the forehand and backhand strokes alternate as this really helps you get used to the quick switches in arm, wrist and bat needed to play both strokes in succession.\nThings to remember\nThere are lots of things to remember for this drill;\nStay up to the table\nAs the rally gets faster and there becomes less and less time in between your strokes in can be tempting to drop back from the table slightly to give yourself more time. Try to avoid this! You will likely end up changing your stroke and playing a much weaker shot. It’s also good to push yourself and force yourself to get faster with your footwork and arm to keep up with the rally.\nKeep the ball on the table\nRemember, the aim is long rallies. If you are making too many mistakes, slow it down. Your target is still 50 shots in a row, to the right place on the table for your partner. Make sure you are being both consistent and accurate.\nGetting side-on for the forehands\nIf you are playing into a backhand control (from a right-hander) then you really need to make sure you are getting your feet round into a side-on position to allow you to play a natural forehand down the line. It’s easy to move across but keep your feet quite square to the table but this will lead to an unnatural forehand technique without much twisting or turning from your body. If you get side-on for your forehand drives down the line then you will be able to play a much more natural stroke.\nWhen controlling…\nIf you are controlling for your practice partner (it can’t always be our go to do the drill, unless we’re getting one-to-one coaching), don’t switch off! Being the controller is good practice too. Focus on your placement and control of the ball. Try and get all of your balls to the middle forehand to hit the center line on the table and keep yourself in a good ready position and stance. If your partner should happen to play the ball to the wrong place (for example, to your forehand when you are using your backhand to control), try to play a forehand stroke, instead of an unnatural backhand from your forehand side. To do this you need to be watching your partner and their shots carefully.\nTake the forehands over the table\nAs we get move side on we can sometimes find ourselves taking our forehand shots a little late. Keep yourself leaning forwards and try to play them still slightly over the table, instead of letting the ball pass over the end line before you make contact.\nI really like this drill and I hope you will too! A video is definitely on it’s way in the next few weeks, so keep an eye out for that, and you might like to subscribe to my YouTube channel. It’s blank at the moment but I’ve now got a video camera and I’ll be uploading soon!

    "title": "Should You Carry a Spare Table Tennis Bat?",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nFebruary 26, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nShould You Carry a Spare Table Tennis Bat?\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nShould You Carry a Spare Table Tennis Bat?\nI’ve had another question from a table tennis parent, this time regarding equipment. You can view other Q&A posts, and ask me a question yourself,\nhere\n.\nRichard asked;\n“Hello Ben,\nDo people that are playing table tennis regularly keep a spare bat ready to go, or rely on running repairs? My daughter recently had a rubber start to come off her bat, prior to a tournament, and it required some urgent repairs.\nAlso, many players at clubs appear to only have one blade but to me it seems sensible to have a spare one made up just in case. Does the rubber deteriorate once cut and glued even if not used? Could this be why?”\nResponse\nMost serious players that I encounter\ndo\nhave a spare bat with them. Personally, I always have three bats in my bat case but that’s because I’m a coach. I use my spare bat for all my coaching (to save the rubbers of my competition bat) and I have a third bat to give out to any players that manage to forget theirs (this happens at pretty much every session I run because I work in a school).\nMany table tennis bat cases, such as the one to your right, are “double wallets” meaning they have space to accommodate two bats. So, it appears that the equipment companies, at least, are assuming that many players will carry a spare.\nHowever, you will find that most players (excluding the top ones or the wealthy ones) have an old blade and used rubbers as their spare bat. It’s a bat that could be used in an emergency but would be far from ideal. Few seem to have an identical copy of their competition bat.\nI think that the majority of the top players have practice-only bats and competition-only bats and many play each tournament with fresh rubbers. In the old speed glue days I believe this was much worse with some of the top players changing rubbers pretty much every single day!\nI would recommend that you carry some kind of spare bat, just in case. You don’t really want to be carrying glue around with you all the time or having to play with a friends bat if anything was to happen to yours. Ideally, it should be similar to the bat you are used to playing with. If you can afford it, there is no reason not to make up two identical bats and use one for practice and one for competitions. I don’t think the rubbers will deteriorate very much if they are left untouched.\nI hope that helps and if you have any other questions please leave a comment below. Thanks for a great question Richard!"

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nApril 15, 2016\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Training – Tips for Parents\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Training - Tips for Parents\nThis is the first in a series of blog posts I’m calling “A Parent’s Guide to Table Tennis”. I believe this is a really important topic as parents have a big, and often undervalued, role to play in the development of their children’s sporting abilities.\nThe idea is to share some of the wisdom I’ve picked up over the years from speaking to the parents of competitive table tennis players. Many have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours supporting their children at the numerous training sessions and tournaments that occur every week. In fact, they are often as much immersed in the learning process as the players are!\nI hope that this series will help to guide other parents as they nurture and assist their kids. You can find all the posts in this series in my\nTable Tennis Coaching Archive\n.\nTable Tennis Training\nIn this article, I’ll be covering the decisions that need to be made regarding your child’s table tennis training.\nParents generally have the biggest influence on how much a junior player can train – as they are usually the ones that decide where and when training can happen. They are also typically the ones getting the players to and from the training sessions and paying for all of the various costs.\nParents have to make a lot of decisions and use their judgement in so many aspects of the sport. Ultimately, it is the player that has to hit the ball, but what the parent can do is create the opportunity for putting the player in an environment where they can learn the most.\nTraining at home\nOne question that often comes up is about training at home. Is it a good idea to buy a table for your home?\nIf you have a big enough property, where you can put up a table and have some space to play around it, this can actually be quite an effective way to help, particularly in the early stages of playing. It eliminates travel time and you can play for as long as you want, whenever you want.\nIf the table is going into a garage or conservatory, check the suitability of the table construction due to the temperature and humidity ranges you might get. Cold winters and hot summers can play havoc on a traditional wooden table. An outdoor table (used inside) is often a very good option for garages and isn’t affected by any extreme environmental conditions.\nWhen the player is a beginner, not having a lot of space around the table isn’t too much of a disadvantage and can actually help the player learn to stay close to the table as there isn’t any space for them to retreat. The considerations for effectively playing at home are more in the medium and longer term. Who will the player train with? Unless you are a decent player yourself, then it will be hard for them to train well and progress without a good partner. However, if there are siblings who want to play together this can be a perfect way for them both to improve.\nSpace starts to really matter as their movement and power increases. This happens quite quickly if they are training regularly, so playing in the garage won’t really work long-term – unless it is a very large one! In reality, the minimum size room you will need to have is about 7 metres by 4 metres. For perspective, tournament courts are often 10 metres by 5 metres.\nDon’t underestimate the extra lighting and also heating needed if you are in an outside building like a garage. Also, note that some coaches may not want to come to homes due to insufficient space and potential insurance concerns.\nTraining at a club\nIdentifying a good training venue which is set up for table tennis is generally the best option as the player will usually outgrow the home situation relatively quickly, maybe within less than a year.\nA table tennis club should have good tables, lighting and flooring, which is suitable for learning to play high-level table tennis.  Though some clubs will have their own purpose built facilities with their tables always up and available, there can still be some great clubs operating in shared sports centres on specific days and times of the week. It varies hugely and a dedicated venue isn’t necessarily the best option. The quality of the training is much more reliant on the quality of the players and coaches rather than the venue not being optimal.\nChoosing a club to train at in itself can be a bit of an ongoing process. This is where good networking and asking other parents and coaches for advice is absolutely vital. Some locations are blessed with multiple clubs but it may be there is only one in your area.\nThis is the point when you might have to consider how much travel is needed. As a general rule, the better the player becomes, the amount of travelling required for training is usually going to go up quite substantially. This is because there are simply much fewer players and coaches further up the performance pyramid.\nClubs can, therefore, be suitable for different periods in your child’s development. They may run a great beginner session but then have nothing for intermediates to go into. Or very good high-level sessions but only with limited spaces on specific nights. This is one of the areas where, as a parent, you need to invest time and not be put off by any short-term issues at a club. Players and coaches can move around and the situation at a club can often be quite transient. This creates opportunities but also means you have to be constantly on the lookout for how the change impacts you.\nOne thing to consider is… don’t judge the club on just one session. Stick things out for at least four or five sessions because not every session will be good. Even the best coach in the world is going to be less than perfect. Sometimes a session can be fantastic, the players have energy and enthusiasm, and other days it just doesn’t work as well.\nTeaming up with other parents can help to secure players of a known standard at the training. From the club’s perspective, they also need some commitment from the players and parents, as the facilities and coaches cost the same irrespective of the number of players at a session. Committing for a number of weeks allows the club to plan better and is also more of an incentive to yourself to keep going.\nWhen a session becomes popular, the club is more likely to prioritise players who are down for a term of training than on a “show up and pay” basis. It is also important to recognise that clubs operate for many different types of players and not just for training juniors. Many clubs will have teams in different types of competitions and being part of this can be another way to learn and progress.\nQuality and Quantity\nHow long is a piece of string? This is actually the answer to another often asked question; how much should a player be training? It isn’t difficult to realise that the more you practice an activity, the better you get. But is it simply “do as much as possible”, or just a bit more than the nearest rival players?\nClearly a lot depends on what level your child is currently at and what their goals are – though it isn’t as straight forward as saying, “I’m a beginner and I want to be an international player”. In fact, I am sure most players and parents don’t have any particular goals when they start playing. They simply want to participate in a fun sport and see what happens.\nOnce a week for one to two hours will be an excellent start to give players their first experience of table tennis. The main thing is to be able to go to a session that is at a suitable level and that they find enjoyable enough to make it a regular commitment over time and perhaps be able to continue even during holidays. Often the biggest progress is made during the holiday sessions where more hours can be fitted into the week.\nSchool-based clubs or local community centres are often the starting point, and the coach of these sessions is looking at keeping players actively engaged in the whole session rather than any major technical developments in the strokes. The coach might start to be able to recognise which players show more interest and perhaps more potential to go further.\nA table tennis club that offers junior training usually has different sessions set up for ability levels. After an initial assessment the club will make a decision based on the ability level and also available spaces. It won’t be uncommon that a parent thinks their child is better than the group they are allocated to. However, training is not just about who can win a short match or hit one or two big shots. The coaches will be looking at many aspects of the players overall ability. Touch, ball tracking, athleticism, hand co-ordination, consistency, concentration and training attitude might just be a few of the things they are considering. Some players can win matches at a lower level with some good serve and receive skills but are poor at consistency and won’t train so well.\nSince time is always precious, rather than looking at simply the number of hours your child attends a session, consider how many strokes they are making and how that changes over time and in different sessions. Beginners with poor coordination and concentration, struggle to keep the ball on the table and will be spending most of their time just looking for the ball at the back of the hall. Advanced players who are committed to improve and who are given a ready supply of balls to hand could each exceed a 1000 strokes an hour.\nThe stroke output differs vastly depending on players and circumstances. Even having enough balls around can make a big difference if you add up all of the lost minutes chasing a single ball around a large hall. So, finding the right session where there is sufficient concentration by the players and a general positive attitude to improve can actually be the most important step in the player’s development journey. This is where the parent can monitor and adjust depending on the level and goals of the player.\nThough I said focus on what happens in the session rather than counting the hours, just for some perspective it might well take over 1,000 hours of practice before the basic stroke techniques and combinations are possible. Clearly some players will be quicker or longer than this very rough guide.\nThat figure is quite a daunting prospect. It could take around two years of playing 10 hours a week to get the basics properly sorted out. There are other sites and books that will better explain why table tennis is so hard, but it appears there are no obvious shortcuts. Recognising the concept and opportunity of more quality training rather than just “attending” training sessions is one way to at least make the journey as short as possible.\nGoing “all-in”\nA lot of young table tennis players will have been exposed to many other sports as they go through their school years. Getting chances to play multi sports at a young age is considered to be important for the overall sporting development of a child. However, there does come a tipping point in the player’s development where there is simply not enough time in the day to maintain all of the different activities including academic studies.\nA player might have already got to a very good standard in another sport in parallel to developing their table tennis skills. However, the combined challenge of training and competing at a high level in more than one sport can simply be too much.\nThere can also be external pressures to deal with from coaches and clubs when schedules will inevitably collide. There will come a point where the player needs to make a decision about which sport they want to pursue over the others. Coming to a good decision should involve advice and input from many people including the coaches and perhaps parents who have been through a similar situation. The more candid feedback you can get on potential and opportunities, the better.\nWhen thinking about table tennis versus other sports there will be some clear differences and similarities to consider…\nTable tennis is an individual sport. Obviously, there can be a doubles element and sometimes being part of a team in leagues and competitions is also possible. However, even then, you are always competing as an individual against another individual. Your results are very hard to hide from. Your performance is measured in points won and lost. Every month a ranking will sort out who has improved over others, be that locally, nationally or internationally. In this respect, the sport is a meritocracy of individual performance. This spotlight of personal performance can be exactly what your child loves or hates. It can encourage or discourage improvement.\nCoaches of team sports have to make difficult selection decisions which often brings them into conflict with parents. With table tennis, there are two players and one ball. Football, twenty-two players and one ball. Even the best footballer playing for the best team touches the ball only a few minutes in a game. So even being selected for a football team doesn’t guarantee too much. In table tennis, you are always fully involved.\nTable tennis is an antagonistic sport, the action of your opponent has a direct bearing on you. Being able to handle the mental battle between yourself and an opponent is often the difference between players. Having mental resilience and the desire to win is an important asset.\nThough table tennis is a hard sport to master well, there could still be more opportunities or possibilities to progress upwards compared to other sports simply based on the numbers of players competing in each sport. Something like football has a massive number of players so even though there are a large number of professional players, that still represents just a fraction of a percentage of the players training at a high level in teenage years.\nOne interesting point in favour of table tennis compared to some other sports is that physical stature isn’t such a major discriminator in performance. If you look at physical statistics of elite players in basketball or netball, the most obvious connection between the players is that they are all going to be very tall compared to the average. Table tennis does require high athleticism but the overall stature has less of an impact on elite performance.\nIf you look at the development of the majority of top international table tennis players you will be hard pressed to disagree with the conclusion that if you want to make it as a pro you need to go “all-in” as early as possible."

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJune 8, 2016\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Competitions – Tips for Parents\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Competitions - Tips for Parents\nThis is the second in a series of blog posts I’m calling “A Parent’s Guide to Table Tennis”. I believe this is a really important topic as parents have a big, and often undervalued, role to play in the development of their children’s sporting abilities.\nThe idea is to share some of the wisdom I’ve picked up over the years from speaking to the parents of competitive table tennis players. Many have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours supporting their children at the numerous training sessions and tournaments that occur every week. In fact, they are often as much immersed in the learning process as the players are!\nI hope that this series will help to guide other parents as they nurture and assist their kids. You can find all the posts in this series in my\nTable Tennis Coaching Archive\n.\nContents\nTable Tennis Competitions\nWhere should we start?\nWhat next?\nHow do international competitions work?\nWhat should we expect at a tournament?\nHow much does it cost to compete?\nHow often should a player compete?\nHow can we evaluate performance?\nWhat should I do if I’m “corner coaching”?\nHow can we keep it fun?\nTable Tennis Competitions\nThis article looks at the many aspects of table tennis competitions. There are plenty of things to consider so I hope this will help you navigate through the various opportunities your child has to compete in this fantastic sport.\nOne very obvious task for parents in the area of competition is dealing with the emotional challenges that will be faced along the way. So, preparation for competition, both for yourself and the player, starts with considering what actually happens in a competitive match.\nTable tennis is one of those antagonistic sports where your skills are pitched directly against a single opponent. This means your own performance is directly impacted by the action of the opponent. The outcome can be far from certain and as all of this comes together it can create emotionally charged situations.\nThere will be tight rallies lost on an edge. Matches will swing back and forth in favour of both players. You will, unfortunately, face some heavy losses – sometimes unexpectedly.\nHaving some mental durability to accept the defeats and disappointments is as much needed for the parents as it is for the players. Though the parent can perhaps better understand the longer-term perspective, and recognise that there will be plenty of lows as well as highs, the player might not be able to see it that way – particularly straight after a match!\nRegardless of the ability of the player, there will be many difficult defeats which somehow you will need to help your child through. In fact, as you progress in age, level, and experience, the stakes are often much higher and the defeats potentially harder to take. Each loss can have far bigger consequences, such as ranking or even prize money.\nIn order to support their child with the best effect, a parent must be capable of handling the wins and losses themselves. It can be much more stressful watching than actually playing. If the parent is unable to manage their own emotions, then it will be hard for them to give balanced advice and support to the player. Being well balanced is not getting too carried away with the high of a big victory, or becoming disillusioned after a tough loss.\nThe great thing about sport is that there is always another chance. They will probably have a tournament the very next weekend, so you need to quickly move on regardless of the outcome. A forward-looking viewpoint is always what you hear from top players and coaches.\nThe ability to be able to control your emotions can actually take many years to master as you follow your child through levels of competitive table tennis, and each parent has their own way of managing things. Some stay very close to the action whereas others prefer to follow the score from a bit more of a distance.\nHopefully, now you have some understanding of the challenge facing you as the parent of a competitive table tennis player. But don’t panic. This article will guide you through the entire process – from entering your first tournament to a potential international call-up. There are also answers to all of the frequently asked questions I encounter from parents.\nWhere should we start?\nSelecting which competitions to enter is one of the first minefields you will need to cross as a table tennis parent. Obviously, there are many levels of competition but how do they all link together? How do you get from the school hall to perhaps one day playing on the international stage?\nOften the very best place to start is at the school or club. They should host smaller local competitions for their players. This would generally be for the younger age groups as that is typically where the beginners will be.\nFocusing on your club is probably the best thing to do before venturing further afield. The club’s aim will be to put on a lot of matches and avoid having a straight knockout system. So, a round robin format where everybody plays each other is often used. At this level, the matches might last between 10 to 15 minutes and there will be breaks and rotations for players to score.\nIt can take several hours to complete a group of matches and this is where parents can help to keep things on track, as young players often seem to disappear when they are needed to play or score, so the next match doesn’t start. If you want to finish on time it is better if parents are giving a hand to the tournament organiser.\nHowever, watch out not to become directly involved in your child’s matches because there is the danger that you’ll be asked to help in adjudicating over a confused decision that the players and scorer can’t resolve.\nThe best advice is to let the players try and get on with it on their own, as much as possible. The player in the match has the responsibility to check that the score is correct, not the parent. One thing to remember is not to play the next point until the scorer has correctly turned over the scoreboard.\nWhat next?\nFor the player wanting to progress beyond their school or club, there are plenty of options.\nClub leagues, like the national cadet and junior league available in England, offer some of the best competitions. They are held at many different centres around the country to try and reduce travel time but also offer a wide group of ages and abilities.\nPlayers are part of a team and play in a league which runs over a series of weekends against players of similar ability. Sometimes there are mixed leagues if there are not enough girls to have a dedicated female competition. As a player and team get better they progress into the next level. The main thing is there are lots of matches as it is a league format rather than a knockout. It also gets the player onto the ranking system in England, which is a great incentive for some of the players.\nMost counties/regions run cadet and junior teams as well and should have a selection day which then offers the player more possibilities to play in different age groups and standards. In England, they have a mixed team of boys and girls to play against other counties in a league format over a few weekends.\nAs an individual player, there are also many competitions available, which at first can seem both daunting and confusing. In England, the national junior circuit is a series of competitions held at different table tennis clubs around the country across the age groups.\nThe highest standard is a 4*, which usually has qualified umpires at all the tables and sometimes prize money for the winners. The next level down are the 2* and 1* tournaments, which often restrict higher ranked players from entering. Ranking points will determine things like seeding in the draws used in each event.\nWithin England, the circuit tournaments are advertised via the national association website and typically you will need to enter at least two weeks in advance. It is these sorts of competitions where you will see some of the best cadets and juniors battling away. They are fighting for the trophies, sometimes prize money, but most definitely it is the ranking points that they are striving for.\nEach competition has a certain weighting towards ranking and there are also bonus points on offer. In fact, that is another thing to be aware of as a parent – players excessively worrying about losing ranking points at a competition rather than just focusing their mind on trying to play well. Generally speaking, players should start by looking at the local 1* tournaments first and gradually working their way up the events as they improve.\nNational associations will offer competitions at regional and national level. They might have a regional qualifying format in order to go to nationals or, as it is now organised in England, players are invited to national events based on ranking. They will hold a national final for the different age groups towards the end of the season.\nHow do international competitions work?\nThe highest level of competition is the ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) junior and cadet events. They have a tournament circuit which runs across the world for the best junior players (Under 18) and cadets (Under 15) to compete approximately once per month.\nThese competitions, which carry world ranking points, are held in different countries and it is generally the national team players of a country who participate in these events as it is the national association that actually has to enter the players. There are a limited number of places allocated to each country unless they are the host nation. So, in order to compete in these events, you need to work with your national association.\nAdditionally to these circuit tournaments, there are Continental and World Championships for Juniors and Cadets. A lot of these players will go onto greater things on the Senior Pro Tour. Playing at this level requires not only a highly skilled player but a significant amount of money and time away from home, and this is often during school time.\nHowever, there are other ways to have the opportunity to compete internationally via open events and table tennis festivals. Some associations or regions create events in order to give opportunities for their up and coming players to play against players from other nations.\nThese are often fantastic opportunities to play lots of matches against some different players in lots of formats of competition. It can be as much a cultural experience as anything else and allows players to get experience against many new players. Again, this isn’t a low-cost affair but they are typically scheduled during the school holidays to maximise participation.\nWhat should we expect at a tournament?\nMost cadet and junior events are scheduled on the weekends and generally speaking the absolute minimum a competition takes is half a day. If you are entering several age groups it can often take much longer! So, if you factor in travel time, it can mean travelling the night before or a very long day if you don’t fancy spending a night in a hotel.\nSome competitions are also held over two days and therefore the time away from home does add up. The time factor can be quite off-putting initially, especially if you are used to playing a team sport like football or netball where the whole thing is done in a couple of hours.\nIn a typical table tennis tournament, there are several stages used to determine the overall winner and with so many players entering it takes time to work through all of the rounds.  For a young player, being able to perform as well at 7pm as they did at 9am isn’t easy.\nGiven all of this, it is probably wise to build up the amount of time spent at competitions step by step. A good approach might be to begin with local ones that don’t involve a lot of travel and to enter just one age group to see how the day goes. You might see other competitors entering every age group, but they have probably been doing the competition circuit for a while and are used to a full day of competing.\nPlaying their first ranking tournament can be very off-putting for a new player. When arriving in the hall, it’s almost like that first-day-at-school feeling. The scale and size of the event can feel like the big busy playground. Lots of noise coming from so many tables and players. Everybody seems to know what they are doing and where they have to go. The other players all have partners to practice with and lots of them are wearing kit with their club or name emblazoned on the back.\nHow will we ever fit into this environment where everybody already knows each other? This is where the survival skills you use wisely at the school gate need to kick in. The trick is to just get stuck in and start asking people for help. In fact, the competition hall is often the best place to find information as it will be filled with other parents on the same mission as you – trying to get their kid through the experience in a positive way.\nIt’s a good idea to work at establishing a strong network of parents who all frequent the same tournaments and events. This can be beneficial for a wide range of reasons. For example, hosting a player who is competing in your area to save hotel costs can be something that parents will do to help each other out.\nHow much does it cost to compete?\nA mini tournament at your local club can be as cheap as a few pounds. Competing at the highest level of national and internationals will run into many hundreds if not thousands of pounds. So, there is a big range of expenditure depending on how you go about things.\nCosts to consider include; the entry fees, travel, and possibly accommodation. One way of looking at things in a purely financial way is to work out the cost per the number of matches you expect to play. When you have to travel there is perhaps more incentive to enter some additional age groups as the extra entry cost is marginal compared to what you will be spending on travel and accommodation.\nIf you are working on a tight budget you may choose to be selective on the level of competition entered and the distance travelled. So, for example, entering a 4* tournament whilst still a beginner might provide good experience but it will be a very expensive price per match. A 2* tournament should offer much more value as you would expect to progress further in the competition.\nIf you are a stronger player you might not enter many 2* events as there is little to be gained from the matches compared to the money and time spent. In fact, many of the top cadets and juniors will only enter the minimum number of circuit tournaments required in order to qualify for the national events. This is as much to keep down the costs as it is the time away from home.\nJust for some perspective, many of the top cadet and junior players (who are in their national teams) will be away from home well in excess of 50 nights per year playing table tennis.\nHow often should a player compete?\nThis is a difficult question as it is very much connected to the individual circumstances of the player. Some players hate training and love competition. So, to a certain extent, the competition time helps them to improve more than the training time does. Others find a lot of competition to be quite stressful and tiring.\nProbably the best advice is put together a plan for the next few months to see what sort of competitions are available for the level needed and find a good balance between competing regularly but also having some breaks to rest and do other things. However, it’s important to be flexible with the plan. You don’t need to actually enter the tournament until just before the deadline.\nHow can we evaluate performance?\nFor a young player it is rather unrealistic (and potentially unhelpful) to measure progress in terms of winning tournaments and taking home trophies. Instead, you are better off using a few basic goals – win a set, win a match, win two matches on a day etc.\nAs the player becomes more proficient the goals can be set for the short and longer term. For example, the long-term goal of the season could be to reach the semi-final stages of a 2* event. In order to do this, the short term goal could be as simple as to get out of the group stages of a tournament. In order to do that, they will need to win one or two matches in the group stage.\nIt’s a good idea to keep track of the scores achieved in matches and calculate the points ratio between the points won and lost. You can compare this over time and track the progress of how that ratio changes depending on improvement and level of competition.\nAs a parent, recognising where the gaps are in achieving certain goals and objectives can be helpful feedback for the coach. For example, it could be that you notice the other players seem to have better serve and receive, so if your child could win a few more points in this area of the game it could tip the balance from losing to winning.\nOften the player won’t acknowledge this deficiency in their game as they might not recall what happened during the match or find the feedback difficult to accept from you as the parent, not the coach. It can also be hard to spot if you are not so familiar with the game so it might be worthwhile to video a few of the matches. Ones that you lost will feel a bit hard to watch but you learn a lot more from them than the victories.\nSome parents and players feel self-conscious about the video process but you need to get through that. You must get the permission from the event organiser and unless there are objections (from the other player, parent or coach), just set up the video and hit record. After a while, both players forget about it.\nYou don’t need to watch back every single match. Instead, pick the matches versus players they consistently struggle against.\nWhat should I do if I’m “corner coaching”?\nCurrently, when you are at an individual tournament, a player is allowed a single coach to give advice at the end of a set and during a time out. In the future, it has been proposed that coaching will be allowed throughout the match.\nHow many see some players being supported by club coaches, but many players will be on their own or have their parents to support them. If you are able to get a coach to do the cornering then clearly this is ideal, however, don’t underestimate what you can still do yourself.\nEven if your table tennis knowledge is quite limited you will be able to provide advice at the corner because you know your child. Often it is the emotional support that provides the biggest benefit to a player over any technical things. They are not going to learn new techniques at the end of a set but you may be able to help in the emotional element of the match. For example, some players do better when they are excited and alert, while some need to be calmer.\nSometimes parents will help each other and offer advice to players and parents who are just starting out in tournament play. Don’t feel intimidated to ask other coaches for their advice after a match as well. If you lost the game, maybe the opposing coach can give you a few comments about what he thought were the key points in the match. Try to recognise the turning points in a match if the game changed and see how the coach might have provided that influence.\nWhen to call a time-out can be a worry for parents. However, there are patterns that the more experienced players and coaches use, which is generally to take time-outs at key points earlier in the match rather than waiting until it is unrecoverable. They might actually time-out in an offensive moment when they have set or match points in their favour because they want to close out the game using a set play. Even a defensive time-out might be early in the match.\nIn the corner, make sure you have plenty of fluids available for the player during the match. Between matches make sure they take some calories on-board. Don’t underestimate the physical exertion in table tennis and particularly when playing in hot conditions. Energy levels can quickly drop off and if you make it far in the tournament you still need to deliver the best performance at the end of the day.\nHow can we keep it fun?\nAt the start of the article we talked about the emotional aspects of the sport and we will conclude on a similar point.\nCompetitive table tennis is challenging and it will be impossible to progress up the levels without some bumps along the way. However, for a player to continue in the sport for the long term it has to be an overall enjoyable experience.\nEnjoyment can come from many different aspects of the sport. This could be the training, the matches, and particularly the friends that will become an integral part of the whole experience. Finding the right balance of competition for each individual player is perhaps the key to this.\nSome players will be self-motivated to strive towards the very top, and that is fun for them. For other players, keeping the level of competition local might be all they want to do. Both are equally great experiences for the players. One of the best things you can do as a parent is genuinely listen to and support the preferences and decisions of your child."

    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nSeptember 19, 2016\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Equipment – Tips for Parents\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Equipment - Tips for Parents\nThis is the third in a series of blog posts I’m calling “A Parent’s Guide to Table Tennis”. I believe this is a really important topic as parents have a big, and often undervalued, role to play in the development of their children’s sporting abilities.\nThe idea is to share some of the wisdom I’ve picked up over the years from speaking to the parents of competitive table tennis players. Many have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours supporting their children at the numerous training sessions and tournaments that occur every week. In fact, they are often as much immersed in the learning process as the players are!\nI hope that this series will help to guide other parents as they nurture and assist their kids. You can find all the posts in this series in my\nTable Tennis Coaching Archive\n.\nTable Tennis Equipment\nThe idea of this article is not to recommend any particular piece of equipment – you can find my\ntable tennis equipment\nrecommendations\nhere\n– but rather to help you with some of the questions and decisions that you will need to make when equipping your child to\nplay table tennis\n.\nUnfortunately, you will quickly discover that there are very few dedicated table tennis shops, where you can physically browse for products. If you go to a general sports shop, they might have some very basic\ntraining balls\nand possibly a\nlow-cost beginner bat\n. Anything else is generally not available on the high street. Some\nclubs\ncarry a small selection of items for sale, but the majority of table tennis purchases are made remotely, either online or via the phone/catalogue.\nI recommend visiting\nMegaspin.net\nif you are in North America or\nTabletennis11.com\nfor everywhere else.\nHowever, if you do want to physically look at and purchase equipment as you would in an actual shop, then some of best places to go to are the larger\ntournaments\nwhere suppliers set up a trade stand. Generally, these trade stands will be aligned to favour one brand in particular, but they usually carry most blades and rubbers. They can offer advice on\nequipment\nand will also do useful things such as\ncutting and glueing the rubbers\nfor you.\nClothing\nWhen it comes to the playing textiles needed for table tennis, the main thing to check is the colour of the shirt, as this is the only restriction within\nthe standard rules of table tennis\n. The shirt colour should be different to the colour of the ball. With the ball colour usually being white, it means to avoid this for shirts and shorts. In fact, it is practically impossible to buy a branded table tennis shirt in white!\nAny general sportswear shirts, shorts, or skirts should be fine for playing table tennis, though it can be nice to get some of the table tennis branded apparel. Often the club will have a specific match shirt that is needed for team events and they might have a deal on the price.\nLike all clothing producers, the main brands bring out new shirts each year and will run them for a couple of years. It’s worth checking the clearance lines and promotions, as they often have some very good prices if you are lucky with the sizes. Each brand can have slightly different dimensions for the equivalent size, so if you are worried try and check with other players before ordering.\nAnother thing to check is the arm movement around the sleeve. This can bother some players if the sizing isn’t quite right.\nPrinting on shirts is quite common but be careful of the added costs this can bring. Sticking a name on the back of a shirt also means you can’t pass it onto someone else (like a younger sibling) when your child has grown out of it.\nShoes\nYou can get\ntable tennis shoes\nbranded by the major table tennis suppliers, but again there are good alternatives from other companies. Try to look for the “court” type of shoes that offer good support and then ideally just keep them only for indoor use. There is nothing worse as a table tennis coach than to see a group of players bringing in a load of mud and dust from outside into the sports hall!\nWhen your child is playing, you will find that each venue will have varying amounts of grip. They might have to play at a venue that has many different uses of the floor. For example, some dancing classes put chalk on the floor and this makes it very hard to grip. One trick is to keep the sole of the shoe slightly damp with a wet towel to stand on, as this can improve the grip on a very slippy floor.\nThe other extreme of friction is the Taraflex table tennis flooring which has an insane amount of grip. Playing on this for the first time can actually feel uncomfortable as your toes jam into the ends of your shoes. It is also extremely abrasive to the shoes, so the soles can wear out quickly.\nFor further information please have a read of my article,\nThe Best Table Tennis Shoes\n.\nTables\nIf you are going to buy a\ntable tennis table\nfor your home, there are a few things to consider. Indoors or outdoors is the first main question.\nIndoor tables\nare generally made from a wooden top whereas an\noutdoor table\nis usually fabricated with a type of melamine/resin surface and metal frame. Indoor tables require more care and attention for playing and storage conditions as the wooden surface can become damaged with high humidity and temperature variations. Putting a wooden table in a garage is certainly possible, but there is also the risk of some damage in the long term if adverse conditions are experienced.\nConversely, an outdoor table can be used in any situation but there is usually less choice, particularly at the higher quality end.\nThe thickness of the table establishes some aspect of quality because a thicker table gives a more consistent bounce. To that point, some tables are certified as suitable for competitive table tennis due to passing an ITTF quality and bounce test.\nHowever, the thicker the table, the stronger the frame required to support it. This increases the overall weight of the table significantly. Therefore, if you are having to move the table around a lot, think about how and who will move it.\nSome tables come with two pieces which fold up and down. There are also ones with undercarriages and wheels which can include an integrated net. These are the easiest to move around but take up a bit more space when folded up.\nDue to the variety of types and costs, it is certainly worth having a look at some online reviews, catalogues and also speaking to suppliers. You should also check out my popular article,\nThe Best Table Tennis Tables\n.\nBlades and Rubbers\nThe most talked about area of\ntable tennis equipment\nare the\nblades\nand\nrubbers\n. For any parent who is a bit of a novice to table tennis, this can be a confusing and potentially expensive experience.\nAs I said at the start, I am not recommending a particular piece of equipment – though I am assuming we have now gone beyond the very\ncheap bat\nyou buy from a sports shop. What we are discussing here is the setup of separate blades and rubbers.\nA couple of things to consider first…\nSpending more money doesn’t necessarily mean the equipment is more suitable for a developing player.\nChoosing a setup is often about a compromise – you generally can’t have everything. A faster setup will have more power but will be much harder to control. So, will you lose more points than you win?\nChanging the setup up frequently disturbs the learning process.\nJust to give you some perspective on those first few comments; you can find some very good adult players on the using the same relatively low cost (under £40) wooden blade that they started with as a cadet player. They have gone right through their junior years and into seniors with the same blade!\nPerhaps one of the reasons for them maintaining a blade is that they were playing so much there wasn’t enough downtime to change and the adjustment process would have lost them time. There is also always a risk that a new setup is actually going to be worse.\nIt can take even a national standard player over 6 months to fully adapt to a new blade and rubber setup. Changing blades and rubbers is often seen as a quick fix solution but it will not transform a losing player into a winning player. The best thing to do is focus on a balanced setup that helps the child learn the\nstrokes\n.\nHow to choose given the almost infinite combinations of blades and rubbers?\nIf your child is going to a\nclub\nthat has some coaching, then it is a very good idea to talk to the\ncoach\nabout the blades and rubbers they are using. The coaches will get asked about this a lot and will be used to assessing playing level with respect to equipment choice. It is much harder to describe down the phone to a supplier about playing level so if you want to buy from a remote seller, make sure you note down all of the information that you need to purchase beforehand.\nFor a\nblade\n, you will need to know the type of blade and also specify a handle shape. Handles normally come in straight, flared, and then sometimes anatomical or a narrow one for children. It would be a good idea to check which handle feels most comfortable.\nJust as an example of where this can be difficult to decide, a flared handle might feel more comfortable on the\nforehand\nbut for a child, it might get in the way of their arm on the\nbackhand\n. So, again, it might be a compromise until their hands and arms grow.\nWhen you get a new blade, you might want to take some sandpaper to smooth off the sharper edges that children can find uncomfortable or that give them blisters.\nWhen specifying a\nrubber\n, the particular type might come with different sponge hardness and thickness. The thicker the sponge, the faster the rubber. Not selecting the thickest sponge initially, might offer some development later without having to go to a totally new rubber once the player can handle a bit more speed.\nIt can be difficult for a coach to recommend equipment because players can sometimes get fixated into believing that they need “better equipment” in order to play better. They might see better players with certain equipment and simply want what they have got.\nAlso,\nequipment\ncan be expensive and the most expensive rubbers are not always the most durable ones. If you catch the corner of the table with a brand new sheet of the latest catapult effect rubber, there is a very good chance you will put a big rip into the topsheet.\nWhen (and how) to replace rubbers\nIf your child is playing a lot, rubber costs can actually add up to quite a lot over a season. So, how often to change rubbers?\nOver time a rubber will gradually deteriorate. The topsheet will lose grip and the sponge will start to become “dead”. Apart from the impact damage with the table, the length of time a rubber lasts is pretty much proportional to how much it is used. Some brands and types will last longer than others (or appear to last longer), but there won’t be too much in it.\nAn experienced player will have a feeling for when a rubber needs changing. However, there are several rules of thumb which can be used which are based on your usage. For example, some players will log how much they play with a rubber and after about 100 hours of use consider changing them.\nAnother option is to divide the year by the number of times you play per week. So, if you play three times a week, then change around three times a year. The other extreme is the professional players who are changing their rubbers roughly every seven days!\nIn order to maximise the life of your rubber and blade, you do need to take care of them. Putting the equipment in a\nprotective case\nbetween use is very good advice to take. Also, don’t leave the equipment out in extreme temperatures as this can damage both the rubber and the blade.\nGlueing a rubber to a blade is a skill which parents can learn to do. At first, it is a bit scary to be glueing and cutting such an expensive piece of equipment. The water-based glues stick on contact, so once you are committed to the placement on the blade, you can’t easily move it. However, if you do get it wrong, it is possible to actually peel off the glue and have another go.\nHere’s a YouTube video I filmed a few years back showing\nhow to glue table tennis rubbers to a blade\n…\nThere will be a lot of advice on which glue to use. Some players at your club will swear by using non-table tennis glues. However, to avoid any doubt on suitability, it might be best to use the glue from the rubber supplier. For example, use Butterfly glue with Butterfly rubbers and Stiga glue with Stiga rubbers.\nThe reason I say this is because I have heard of players having some problems when they switched around. It might be some small differences in the glue viscosity and how the pores of the rubbers soak up the glue. Not all sponges absorb glue in the same way.\nMy final point is around\nhaving a spare blade and rubber\n. If your child is playing a lot and entering many competitions, it can be useful to have a backup blade setup with rubbers in the case of damage during a match. Given that blades are made from wood it can actually be pretty hard to find an identical pair of blades, though they should be very close.\nFor more information please ready my popular articles,\nThe Best Table Tennis Blades\nand\nTenergy 05 Alternatives & The Best Table Tennis Rubbers\n.\nBalls\nProbably a few years ago, when the 40mm celluloid ball was in use, there wasn’t too much written about\ntable tennis ball brands\n. The balls all seemed to play in a similar way.\nBut, with the introduction of the\n40+ plastic balls\nover the past few years, there has been plenty of lively discussion on the ball types that are available.\nPlastic balls do play slightly differently to celluloid ones, however, beginners would not really notice this, so there isn’t really a need to change and buy new plastic balls unless you are playing competitively.\nPlastic balls have also evolved in terms of quality and now they are much more consistent than they were. One disadvantage of plastic is that they seem to break more easily than before and also because there are different manufacturing methods this can create some playing difference between the brands.\nIf you are a believer in the philosophy of marginal gains (as I am) then making sure you practice with the brand that you will be using in a competition is something to consider in the days prior. Tournaments will declare which ball they are using beforehand, so it is a good idea to have at least one of those specific balls with you on the day, so your child can knock up with it before the matches start and get used to it.\nAs with the\nblades\nand\nrubbers\n, the plastic balls will deteriorate with extreme temperatures, so try to store them indoors and away from hot and cold places.\nFor a comprehensive review of the differences between the four types of plastic 40+ table tennis balls (DHS/Double Fish, XuShaoFa, Butterfly, and Nittaku) please read my article,\nThe Best Table Tennis Balls\n.\nSponsorship\nOne thing you might notice when attending tournaments is that some of the junior players are wearing shirts with table tennis brand sponsorship logos on them. Some of these might be because the club that they are a member of has a sponsorship arrangement but some might be players with individual sponsorship deals.\nWhy are some players sponsored?\nThe degree of sponsorship potential is very much dependent on the country in which the player lives and of course their playing standard. It mainly comes down to economics related to the sport. Countries which have a large playing base and have a big market for table tennis equipment may have more opportunities than countries where the sport isn’t played so much.\nEquipment sponsorship deals are generally coming from one of two places. Either directly via the brand supplier in the region or via one of the sales agents of a brand. Again this is a very country specific thing. Often in countries such as the UK, branded products are sold via distributors and agents – as the majority of the brands are actually based outside of the UK. These local companies are often the first step in getting any form of equipment sponsorship as they are the people who are working with the clubs and attend tournaments.\nI think we can safely assume the brands/suppliers are not actively looking to find new players, as typically there are many more players wanting support than they can accommodate, but they will be keeping an eye on the best up and coming players. They will want to try and identify who are going to be the future front running players and most likely to be successful in the longer term, not just after one tournament success.\nSome of the support they are giving is, of course, to promote the brand directly but quite a bit is to also encourage the better young players to play more and stay with the sport. Clearly, the more players who are competing, the better it is for growing the sport.\nAn equipment deal can seem like a big thing to obtain in terms of the benefits it brings, however by the time a player is reaching the standards needed for a national junior team, the actual equipment costs will be becoming more of a minor part of the total costs involved in training and competing at that level. So, basically, you need to spend quite a lot of money to get good enough to save a bit of money with equipment sponsorship.\nWhat are sponsors looking for in order to grant a contract?\nClearly, table tennis ability has to come pretty near the top of the list but there are other factors to consider too. The degree of training and coaching the player is receiving might have an impact in terms of providing credibility to the request.\nIn fact, a well-respected coach can effectively act as a reference for a player when called upon. It might not be just playing standard that the sponsor is asking questions about. They will be looking for players who have a strong\nmental game\nand are more likely to remain in the sport despite setbacks that they may face along the way.\nSocial media is having a very major impact on marketing for companies, so being responsible, professional, and effective at social media can be an attractive proposition for sponsors. Keeping an update of your table tennis progress via a blog, Facebook, Twitter etc. demonstrates how you can help a potential sponsor to promote their brand – especially if you have a lot of followers. Also, if they Google your name, what will they find?\nWith the growing use of YouTube streamed and recorded matches, this can be an opportunity for players to show their developing skills to remote sponsors. However, you should also watch out because a video doesn’t lie. Any form of bad or unsporting behaviour, such as throwing bats or kicking barriers, is now completely visible to a worldwide audience and more likely to put off sponsors than attract them!\nWhat are the contracts like?\nThe details of player contracts are usually confidential so it is not possible to give any specific details on what they may contain. However, usually, they will be time bound for a number of years.\nIt isn’t a one-way deal. The sponsor will expect something from the player and this can be various things, but usually the basic point is that the player would need to provide all of their image rights to the sponsor and ensure that whenever they are playing table tennis they are using only the branded products of the sponsor. They would also expect the player to be training and competing often.\nThe kind of equipment provided within the contract will be very much dependent on the playing standard. A junior national champion, playing in the national team, would be more or less guaranteed enough support to cover all of their equipment needs through a playing season; such as rubbers, shirts, shoes etc. They may even receive additional financial support.\nBelow that level, the support is probably going to be much more limited to either just a few free items or a discount on purchasing equipment at a preferential rate.\nFor more information on getting sponsored have a read of my article,\nHow to Get Table Tennis Sponsorship\n."

    "title": "Table Tennis Coaching – Tips for Parents",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nJuly 3, 2017\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Coaching – Tips for Parents\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nTable Tennis Coaching - Tips for Parents\nThis is the fourth in a series of blog posts I’m calling “A Parent’s Guide to Table Tennis”. I believe this is a really important topic as parents have a big, and often undervalued, role to play in the development of their children’s sporting abilities.\nThe idea is to share some of the wisdom I’ve picked up over the years from speaking to the parents of competitive table tennis players. Many have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours supporting their children at the numerous training sessions and tournaments that occur every week. In fact, they are often as much immersed in the learning process as the players are!\nI hope that this series will help to guide other parents as they nurture and assist their kids. You can find all the posts in this series in my\nTable Tennis Coaching Archive\n.\nContents\nTable Tennis Coaching\nAn introduction to your coaching choices\nLocation\nFinding a coach\nDon’t judge a book by it’s cover\nWhat do we expect coaches to do?\nBeginner coaches\nClub coaches\nElite coaches\nCommunication\nExpectations and “coachable” players\nOne-to-one coaching\nCoaching at tournaments\nRemote and e-Coaching\nPlanning and training camps\nTable Tennis Coaching\nThe purpose of this blog post is to help everybody to understand a little bit more about the process of coaching in table tennis. I particularly want to try and offer some tips to parents as they are often the ones that have to make many of the overall coaching decisions and are usually the ones picking up the costs. However, players should also find this information useful too.\nAn introduction to your coaching choices\nThe decisions you take regarding the coaching of your children can be hugely important for their table tennis development. Unfortunately, it isn’t as simple as prescribing a single best solution. The context of each player’s situation and development will impact the coaching needs. That is why it is such a difficult topic for parents as they will quite often see other young players doing different things.\nOne of the reasons there isn’t a single best solution is that players often thrive under very different circumstances. As a consequence, you will find success stories that have been created from both simple and unusual coaching situations. For example, some players can remain with one coach throughout their entire career, whereas others may have had many coaches on their road to the top.\nCircumstances generally have the biggest influence on the available choices, and the ones that impact these most are location and the available budget. Those two things in themselves start the main point around choices…\nHow far are you willing to travel to find a regular coaching session and how much can you spend on this?\nSo, the first aspect is simply to recognize that actually making a choice around coaching is an active topic you need to be engaged in. Finding the right coach for your child does involve some work and it doesn’t just stop the day you walk into a table tennis club.\nBuilding coaching relationships takes time and this is something that parents need to work on as typically it is a three-way communication between the coach, player and parent. If you get it right, it can make a positive difference to a player’s development.\nLocation\nMuch of the choices will depend on your location. The nearest table tennis club might have an amazing coach with all of the necessary credentials who is willing to help your child. Or you might be faced with the other extreme, where no qualified coaches exist, and you then have a much harder task to get some support – or simply have to resort to a form of “do it yourself”.\nCircumstances can also change relatively quickly. The fast-growing ability of a player can actually cause coaching challenges and coaches can turnover too and move on. So, assessing the coaching needs and coaching availability is something that you need to keep your eye on, particularly if your child has dreams beyond the recreational levels.\nOverall, the coaching that you apply can have a similar impact, in terms of performance, to that of teaching within education. You need to have the same mindset of trying to find the most suitable one for your particular circumstances.\nFinding a coach\nIf your child is a total beginner, and you have some space at home, then you can be their first coach. Just putting a bat on the ball, and returning it over the net, is usually enough to keep a young player happy and occupied during the first few months.\nHowever, children pick up the game relatively quickly and if you don’t have the necessary skills they won’t develop too far with just basic help. So, an initial approach just to get started is to either sign up for a club at school or locate the nearest table tennis club with training sessions for children.\nIf you go to a school or club, then there is a greater assurance that the coaches will have the necessary qualifications and clearances for working with children. A school will have the necessary safeguarding procedures for either using PE staff or specialized table tennis coaches. For table tennis clubs, national associations normally keep records of the necessary coaching qualifications.\nAs an example, Table Tennis England show on their website which people hold coaching licenses and the level of qualifications. This type of database can actually be a good resource to find a coach in your area. Also, in order for somebody to have an official coaching license, their safeguarding and protecting children checks would have to be in place and up to date. Additionally, a licensed coach in England would have public liability insurance and be part of a network of information to improve their performance as a coach.\nThe terminology you will see around coaching qualifications is going to be country specific. Within the UK, the UKCC terminology is used to cover coaching in many sports including table tennis. It is a structured set of courses based on achieving levels of increasing mastery in coaching.\nLevel 1 is the first and Level 1 coaches would typically be an assistant to a more qualified coach at a club. The most common level you see as a club coach is Level 2. Further levels can be done but are quite expensive and also take a long time to achieve, so you may not meet many Level 3 or Level 4 table tennis coaches.\nDon’t judge a book by it’s cover\nOne thing to recognize is that the formal coaching level does not necessarily indicate coaching skill or playing level. Playing and coaching require very different abilities and coaches can differ wildly in their effectiveness regardless of their actual qualifications. Clearly, demonstrating shots is an important task for a coach, but equally organizing the training session and keeping 20 children engaged requires a very different skillset than just playing.\nIt can be a bit random on what the playing capabilities of a coach are. Often coaches are ex-players and there can be some seriously good players who only have a Level 1 coaching qualification. However, there are also some very good coaches who haven’t necessarily played the game at the highest level themselves. Generally, as things progress, having experience around the bigger and higher level competitions can be an important consideration.\nThe main point to consider here is coaching first. Focus on how good the coach is as a coach, rather than looking for a great player but who knows little about coaching and instruction.\nOnce you are up and running with a coach and you are going through the first stages, you will start to see how your child is developing and you can then think about what a coach actually does and if this is the right coach for you.\nWhat do we expect coaches to do?\nAgain, there isn’t really a simple answer because of the context but it is certainly something that should be near the front of your mind as you consider how your child develops. If you follow the pathway from beginner to elite, the coaching needs will change quite a bit over that journey. Additionally, the personality and needs of the child will develop alongside their table tennis skills.\nIt could be that a singular person can take a player from their first experiences, right to the top level. However, that’s probably more the exception than the general rule. Usually, the coaches that start children off at clubs by introducing them to the sport are not going to be the same type of coach that supports them in international-level competitions. The reason for this is that very different skills are needed as a coach working at different player levels.\nBeginner coaches\nAt the beginning, a lot of the role of the coach is very much about energizing and engagement. How do they get a new player interested enough that they will be able to concentrate and then practice in a way that builds the necessary skills for the future? This first period of development can be pretty challenging for anybody leading a session.\nProbably the biggest trial is keeping the table tennis fun enough without it descending into total chaos. Setting games up for a group of children with a mix of ages and abilities takes a certain level understanding and empathy. This type of early experience certainly isn’t wasted time on the journey to being a top player. Every young player will have spent the first months of their table tennis education running around a hall waving a bat around in some form of game that roughly resembles table tennis.\nThese formative sessions are vital in igniting the interest and enthusiasm in the game and keeping the player wanting to come back for more. Coaches who can do this week after week are just as valuable to the sport as any of the elite ones – since they provide the pipeline of all the future players at every level.\nClub coaches\nThe next stages of coaching will involve developing the correct strokes and building the many layers of technical and tactical capabilities. Getting the strokes developed to a good level does take time and this is the core activity that young players need to spend time on. Mastering footwork (and then all of the complexities of spin) will keep a young player engaged with a good club coach for years.\nOne of the key skills that good coaches have is observation. They need to be able to observe a group of players’ overall performance and also then the individuals in some significant detail. If you spend time with some of the more experienced coaches and listen to their observations, you will start to see that they are viewing the game through a completely different lens to you.\nInitially, parents tend to focus very much on the outcome as the most important thing. Did their child win a point, or not. So, they tend to follow the ball. A good coach will be looking at so many other additional things in those frantic seconds of action. The point won or lost might be only twentieth on their list of things that they are considering about the player.\nGood coaches seem to have a video camera constantly running in their head, so they can watch a player perform a practice drill and then rewind with several minutes of feedback to the player. Often they are doing this whilst also feeding multi-ball or blocking for a player. They need their playing skills to be totally automatic so that they can focus on the player only.\nElite coaches\nOnce the foundations are in place the coach will begin adding some tactical awareness of how to construct points and win games. Clearly, this becomes more important as players start to enter tournaments and want to see some results for all of their hard training.\nAs players become older and competitions are a lot tougher, the coaching role is often much more about the mental side of the game. How to prepare the mind of a player leading up to a tournament can be a critical role for a coach. Helping them through a tournament and then spending time afterward in feedback is another feature you will see from the higher level coaches who are focused on developing players for the big tournaments.\nCommunication\nParents are often interested in knowing how their child is getting on, so another important skill for a coach is communication – they have to be able to talk with both the player and the parent.\nSometimes parents see things differently to a coach. They might believe their kid needs moving up to a higher group, while the coach has the opposite idea. One thing that parents often don’t realize is that the coach has often seen it all before and is making an overall judgment looking at many different factors.\nHowever, explaining that to an impatient parent who doesn’t feel that their child is being best supported isn’t always the easiest thing to do. Therefore, finding some positive ways to engage with a coach when they can concentrate on your questions and concerns is often a more beneficial approach. Demonstrating that you are interested in the sport by supporting both the player and the coach is much better, rather than just expecting the coach to deliver something for you.\nExpectations and “coachable” players\nHaving a good coach\nshould\nbe an advantage for a player. However, a top coach doesn’t guarantee success. The hours it takes to become a great player are put in by the player, not the coach. The coach can only encourage, guide and offer their experience.\nThere are plenty of situations where a coach is able to extract that extra bit of performance from a player, to get them to focus and deliver in a tournament what they have shown in the practice hall. However, as a parent, you need to always recognize that the player is ultimately responsible for the results.\nNo matter how much you paid for coaching lessons a few days before a big tournament – the coach doesn’t hit the ball.\nIf a player is unable to concentrate and train regularly, that isn’t the best motivation for the coach to work with them. They want to work with players who are as interested in the sport as they are. A lot of coaches are volunteers and are giving up their time, so they want to work with players who love the game and are desperate to learn.\nIn fact, one of the best compliments you can hear about your child is that they are “coachable”. This is a single word which basically explains that the coach can work well with them because they can positively engage with the player. The player is listening carefully to the feedback, responding to the instructions from the coach, and is very interested in learning the game.\nThe “coachable” players are the ones that the coaches will probably gravitate towards in the training hall because they will find it easier and more rewarding to work with them. So, as a parent, helping your child to be more “coachable” can pay a lot of dividends when they are in the training hall.\nOne-to-one coaching\nThe majority of club coaching is done as a group of players. Maybe 10-20 players working together in a sports hall with one or two coaches leading the session. This can be an efficient way to do many hours of practice at a relatively low cost for each player. However, if you concentrated that coaching onto just one player, would that be a better way to improve?\nAre one-to-one coaching sessions worth the extra cost?\nClearly, if you focus all of the coaching time onto just one player, the coach can deliver a very specific and concentrated message. Improvement should come much more quickly than in a group situation. During these sessions, you can do some very useful things – such as multi-ball. Additionally, with a coach, the drills are likely to be much more sustained with a more consistent feed and, of course, they are totally focused on your game.\nWhen it comes to using one-to-one coaching, the vast majority of the top players will get some form of one-to-one as part of their regular training. So, the harsh reality is that if you want to compete at the higher levels then one-to-one coaching is something that you need to seriously consider within the overall coaching plan.\nHowever, my experience with training Sam in\nThe Expert in a Year Challenge\nis that one-to-one coaching certainly isn’t some kind of magic bullet to excellence. There’s only so much you can take in from a coach and sometimes it’s better to try something new with a coach and then spend the rest of week trying to put it into practice during the rest of your sessions and matches.\nSo, perhaps really the question is when and how often should you try and arrange these sessions in between the regular group training and tournaments? In my opinion, if you are serious about improving, then setting something up with a regular coach for an hour a week would make a big difference in your overall performance.\nHow good do you need to be to start having a one-to-one? Is it worth doing this as a beginner?\nWhen the player is a beginner a one-to-one session can seem very beneficial because there are a lot of opportunities to improve. However, it can also be quite intimidating having the focus on just you and then also physically demanding, particularly for a younger child to work continuously over an extended period.\nA coach asking questions and pushing the limits of the player is only beneficial if the player can cope with those demands. Therefore, when the player is younger, having shorter but more frequent sessions is perhaps the best idea.\nAnother important factor to consider is the cost. Depending on your circumstances, one-to-one coaching can be from 5 to 20 times the cost of group training. When it comes to the coaching fee, it fundamentally is about the credentials of the coach, and supply and demand in the area where the coaching takes place. A coach with a strong reputation and a very busy schedule is going to be able to charge much more than somebody who is just starting off in an undeveloped location.\nThe total coaching costs need to be considered in the overall expense for both the parent and the coach. For example, room and table hire, is this included along with training balls etc? How far are you traveling and how far is the coach. So, finding some positive mutual ways to keep costs down is one task the parent can look into.\nAlso, think about maximizing the use of the available time with the coach. For example, do a warm-up before the session starts so you are ready to hit balls the moment the clock starts. Sharing the session with other players is another option. Just as an example, unless the child is very fit it is actually quite hard to sustain a one-to-one practice session with a coach for several hours. Training with a partner, where they take turns at multi-ball (one playing whilst one picks up the balls), can be both effectively economically but also a very pragmatic choice around performance.\nUnless you have done multi-ball training yourself at a sustained high pace it is hard to grasp how much physical effort is being exerted by the player. A young player is unable to do this for minute after minute without a break.\nQuite often clubs provide a mini one-to-one element within the general coaching sessions or as part of their training camps. For example, a couple of players go to the one-to-one coach for 10-20 minute slots and rotate with the other players in the group. This actually can be a good taster for a player on how multi-ball works and they can gauge the benefits of having a longer session with a particular coach.\nCoaching at tournaments\nOne of the most common questions that comes up is… Is having a coach necessary at tournaments?In some\nIn some respects, it would be much easier if no coaching was allowed and players just had to get on with the matches themselves. However, the reality is that coaching during matches is part of table tennis. The rules recently changed to allow coaching to occur more openly during matches so, in reality, corner coaching is now even more important than it was in the past.\nAt the beginner level, having somebody to help a player get through the emotional challenges of a match is perhaps the most valuable thing. Sometimes this works well if the parent handles this because they know the child and how to deal with those situations.\nAs the player becomes more proficient and the level goes up, it does add something to have a coach available to support during matches. The players know what is going on in their match but having somebody to provide some overall perspective can help. For example, how much risk to take during receiving and giving some help on reading some of the serves.\nRemote and e-Coaching\nThere are situations where either your coach can’t regularly observe you playing or you want some tips from people who are not nearby to you. Taking videos of your matches and sharing them with a remote coach can be a very valuable way of getting some feedback on things you can work on. With cloud storage it is now becoming very simple to share video files. Try to record the video from a position where the coach can see both the stroke and the footwork.\nWatching coaching sessions on YouTube can be a good way to see how others are able to train and how they are learning. There are also specific online resources that can be very helpful, such as Coach Tao Li’s\nTableTennisUniversity.com\n!\nDon’t underestimate the power of learning from online video. So many skills are now transferred and learnt through this format. YouTube is becoming one of the biggest teaching mediums, and with dedicated educational sites like Khan Academy, you can see the future. Clearly you still need to do the actual table practice, but watching good players/coaches and listening to their comments is certainly going to be useful.\nPlanning and training camps\nHaving a coaching plan that considers today and the future can help in identifying how to best spend the available time and budget. Thinking through how you spend your budget over something like a season means that you can consider what offers the best value to help you improve. This could be combinations of regular group training, one to one sessions, and also training camps.\nTraining camps offer a great opportunity to give a boost to your playing level and often a place to meet new players and coaches. Training camps are typically held over weekends or during school holidays so this is where having a plan can help map out when to fit them into your schedule of school and holidays. It is definitely worth while discussing training camps with the club coaches or with other parents who may have had their child already on them.\nThe one that always gets great feedback from players is the\nB75 one in Denmark\n. This is run by experienced people (the organizer is a man called Lars Rokkjaer) and the coaches really know how to deliver a great experience for the players."

    "title": "Is Intra-Team Competition Beneficial in Table Tennis?",
    "text": "Ben Larcombe\nAugust 28, 2013\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nIs Intra-Team Competition Beneficial in Table Tennis?\nHome\nThe Expert Table Tennis Blog\nIs Intra-Team Competition Beneficial in Table Tennis?\nDo you ever feel like your table tennis team mates are actually your most significant opponents?\nOr are you a coach or club owner struggling to manage the dynamics of your players in regards to team or squad selection.\nTable tennis is a little strange because despite it being an individual sport we also are united with other players in clubs and teams and academy’s.\nWe need them to practice with but at the same time, when push-comes-to-shove, we are desperate to beat them in tournaments and we want to make sure we are selected ahead of them to play in our teams. Making sure this level of “competition” stays friendly can be quite difficult!\nAnd this is true at all levels of our sport; whether you’re an intermediate player competing for your club in a local league, an advanced player fighting for a place in the club’s national league team or an international player trying to keep your place in the national team. Competition for spaces in the Chinese National Team, for example, is incredibly fierce and players are often put up against each other in televised national trials to gain selection for major tournaments.\nMark Simpson\nis a table tennis player currently studying for a Masters degree in Sports Psychology in Sweden and Germany. Intra-team competition is an area that he has studied in detail and he was kind enough to write a guest post for us on the subject. If you remember the name, it’ll be because Mark wrote another post for the site a while back on\ndeliberate play\n.\nIn this post he has some advice for players, and in particular coaches and team managers, on how best to use competition within teams to ensure all players remain happy and playing their best table tennis.\nI hope you enjoy it…\nAs a coach, should you encourage competition between your players?\nCompeting against players from other teams is normal in table tennis, since national leagues are team against team. The concept less discussed is competition within teams. A lot of national leagues make teams determine their order based on ranking, however, leagues that don’t impose this rule hand the decision over to the coach or manager.\nWhether it is openly acknowledged or not, players within a club\nare\ncompeting against each other for the few spaces on the team, and unlike football, we don’t all have different positions to play. The question is… as a coach, how do you make sure this natural competition between players is beneficial to the team, both as a whole and individually?\nTop-level coaches, in other sports, often talk about the advantages of having competition for places. They attribute this to the removal of complacency in training that is possible if your place on the team is more assured.\nAlthough a debated issue amongst sport psychologists, I personally\nam\nfor the encouraging of inta-team competition. I think it can be very motivating and give that extra ‘zip’ in training.\nBut what could go wrong?\nIntra-team competition motivates people with the goal of getting that spot on the team. If they, therefore, do not achieve this goal it can lead to a lot of frustration, which could lead to less motivation in the long term. Also if the player sees his chance of taking that position as unrealistic, then they are at risk of giving up the battle mentally.\nAnother thing that could go wrong is that players will become selfish and focus on getting the most out of training for themselves, even if it is to the detriment of the other club members, or at worst they may even try to hinder the training of their main rivals in order to gain the upper hand in the battle for places.\nIntra-team competition can also strain the social relationships between players, which can affect the training atmosphere and also affect interactions in matches. For instance, if two of those players need to play doubles, or one is coaching the other, then if they have fallen out it will not work as well. Obviously this is less of a consideration than in team sports but it’s still worth mentioning.\nSo how can we stop this happening?\nThe first couple of problems focus on motivation, which is best dealt with using effective goal setting techniques. The key is to encourage competitive goals within the range of the players realistic capabilities.\nAnother important thing here is to ensure that the players all believe the team selection is fair. This means that the selection of the team is not always on reputation but always on who is in the best form at that moment, and perhaps more importantly, who is putting the most effort in when training. There isn’t much more demotivating to players than to see positions given to people they don’t believe deserve them.\nThe next problems are to do with team cohesion, both socially and on task. This is a key issue if you are aiming to use competition within your team or club. One way to combat this is to build a strong club identity. If you can make the players proud to be a part of the club, even if they are just warming the bench, you’re on the right track. Encourage the wearing of club kit, for example, all players must wear it on match days. Encourage players to turn up to the matches whether playing or not (I am thinking, in particular, of the European leagues, where there are home and away matches). Don’t forget the other benefits this could have, with increased support for your team also making it a more intimidating place for opposition teams to play.\nThe other thing is to ensure that the players place the team goals over their own. This is best done through joint goal-setting for the team.\nFinally, as a coach you always need to be aware of what is going on within the team. If there are players who have fallen out, you need to be aware and help mediate this. If there is one player feeling left out socially, you need to have spotted this and (subtly and sensitively) rectify the problem.\nEnsuring competition is a positive thing in your squad is a difficult thing to do! If this seems too difficult, which is perfectly fine (after all some sport psychologists disagree with within-team competition), then look to eliminate this element wherever possible, for instance utilise a fixed, equal squad rotation system for matches. Or, if you still really want to use intra-team competition, then contact a sport psychologist and they will be able to help out instigating this and/or equip you to control this with more confidence.\nA big thank you to Mark for that post.\nAs a coach I definitely understand the issues around using competition between team mates and the struggle to have it lead to positive results. If you have any comments, questions or experience in this area then please leave a comment below, I’d love to chat to your about it.\nIf you enjoyed this post then have a look at Mark’s new website\nwww.brain-spec.blogspot.com\nfor more posts on a range of topics within sport psychology and details of how to contact him if you would like to find out more."
