"terme": "Forehand loop",
"definition": "Built on top of the forehand drive, adding additional speed, spin and power to the basic forehand; a dominant attacking stroke at intermediate to world-class levels.",
"contexte": "Played against topspin with a slightly more closed bat angle and a brushing contact; recommended only after mastering the forehand drive and the four basic strokes.",

"debutant": [
"Master the four basic strokes and a technically correct forehand drive before learning the forehand loop.",
"Adopt a stance similar to the forehand drive: feet at least 1.5 shoulder widths apart (some closer to 2); right foot slightly further back; knees a little bent; weight leaning forward on the front parts of the feet; upper body relaxed.",
"Activate the leg muscles and keep a low centre of gravity; allow the shoulders to drop and stay relaxed while the lower body provides a solid base.",
"Use the triangle cue for positioning: form a triangle between shoulders and hands; twist so hands align with the right foot; adjust feet so the ball arrives into this point; get the right foot in line with the ball to avoid reaching or getting cramped."
],
"intermediaire": [
"Get lower in preparation compared with a forehand drive.",
"Use more weight transfer: onto the right foot during the backswing, then onto the left foot at contact (right-hander).",
"Increase rotation from the waist (not the shoulders).",
"Use more elbow: shoulder extends the elbow during the backswing, then the elbow flexes at contact.",
"Close the bat angle a little more than for a drive to go over the top of a topspin ball.",
"Accelerate faster through the stroke (more speed/snap).",
"Brush the ball more so the loop has more spin than speed."
],
"avance": [
"Finish with hips roughly square to the table and the bat roughly in front of the face.",
"Avoid letting the bat go too far across the body or allowing it to swing you around; if the bat finishes on the right side, the swing is probably too short or rotation is insufficient.",
"Use a different recovery path from the forward swing: recover backward more in line with the stomach; forward motion travels more in line with the chest.",
"Keep the bat moving to avoid a stop-start phase at the backswing/finish positions.",
"Stay relaxed in the upper body to react quickly to variations."

"Finishing with the arm/bat still on the right side (indicates a swing that is too short or insufficient rotation).",
"Allowing a stop–start at backswing/finish instead of keeping the bat moving."
